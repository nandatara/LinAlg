Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These lecture notes are organised in the form of a 
\emph on
fictitious narrative
\emph default
.
 It is always a pleasant experience when the development of any subject
 is conveyed in a chronological order.
 This is seldom feasible since the historical narrative is never linear.
 There are many detours and many many people have contributed to the subject.
 Many ideas may not have been ripe at the time of their discovery but over
 a period of time people may have realized their importance.
 These ideas then become definitions and Theorems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most books these days are written in a 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 fashion.
 While such an approach has its pedagogical value especially for a begining
 student it tends to become very dry.
 I wonder as to how many people would love to read a dry and boring novel.
 I have tried to write an interesting novel with the aim of keeping the
 reader engrossed.
 In most lectures a 
\emph on
natural question
\emph default
 has been asked and the reasoning behind the Theorems and their proofs has
 been made 
\emph on
plausible.
 
\emph default
Although such a reasoning may not be true in the historical sense it would
 certainly reveal why a particular idea was discovered and even if it was
 not discovered that way then sooner or later the discovery would have been
 imminent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To give a concrete example, in the chapter on Normal Groups, the notion
 of 
\emph on
kernel
\emph default
 arose quite naturally in the context of 
\emph on
homomorphisms
\emph default
.
 These in turn arose from the multiplicative property of an 
\emph on
isomorphism
\emph default
 a topic which originated in the following question: when are two groups
 ``same''? It was discovered that the kernel of a homomorphism was a subgroup
 of the original group with many interesting properties.
 So the natural question was the converse: is every subroup of a group the
 kernel of a homomorphism? In trying to answer this question we are very
 naturraly led to the concept of 
\emph on
conjugation
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
normality
\emph default
.
 Having answered this question and reached an important landmark we explore
 the beauty of the surroundings and are led to motivated proofs of the three
 
\emph on
Isomorphism Theorems
\emph default
 which are the corner stones of Group Theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I hope these lectures are useful and make an interesting reading

Determinants and Their Properties

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the various processes of analysis there are certain classes of functions
 which ocur with remarkable frequency.
 Of these there are some which have been studied with great care, and of
 which general theories have been developed.
 The functions known as 
\emph on
determinants
\emph default
 constitute such a class, and one which is of great importance in some of
 the modern developments of mathematics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the simplest of the many processes giving rise to determinants, and
 that which led Leibnitz in 1693 to their discovery, is the solution of
 systems of simultaneous equations of the first degree.
 His researches in this subject resulted in the statement of some rather
 clumsy rules for eliminating the unknowns from systems of linear equations,
 and exerted no influence whatever upon subsequent investigations in the
 same direction.
 It was over a half century later, in 1750, that Gabriel Cramer first formulated
 an intelligible and general definition of the functions, based upon the
 recognition of the two classes of permutations, as presently to be set
 forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though Cramer failed to recognize, even to the same extent as Leibnitz,
 the importance of the functions thus defined, the development of the subject
 from this time on has been almost continuous and often rapid.
 The name ``determinant'' is due to Gauss, who, with Vandermonde, Lagrange,
 Cauchy, Jacobi, and others, ranks among the great pioneers in this development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the subsequent years the theory of determinants has come into very general
 use, and has, in the hands of such mathematicians as Cayley and Sylvester,
 led to the results of the greatest interest and importance, both through
 the study of special form of the functions themselves and through their
 applications.

\begin_layout Section
The Concept of a Determinant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin this section with a simple algebraic problem, i.e., solving a system
 of linear equations.
 Investigation of this problem will lead us to the important concept of
 a determinant.
 We begin by considering the simplest special cases.
 First we take a system of two equations in two unknowns:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_{11}x_{1}+a_{12}x_{2} & = & b_{1}\\
a_{21}x_{1}+a_{22}x_{2} & = & b_{2}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Here, the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ik}$
\end_inset

 of the unknowns are provided with two indices; the first index shows the
 equation in which the coefficient occurs, and the second index shows the
 unknown with which the coefficient is associated.
 As is well known, the solution of this system has the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{1}=\frac{b_{1}a_{22}-a_{12}b_{2}}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}},\qquad x_{2}=\frac{a_{11}b_{2}-b_{1}a_{12}}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}}.
\]

\end_inset

Next we take three equations in three unknowns:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_{11}x_{1}+a_{12}x_{2}+a_{13}x_{3} & = & b_{1},\\
a_{21}x_{1}+a_{22}x_{2}+a_{23}x_{3} & = & b_{2},\\
a_{31}x_{1}+a_{32}x_{2}+a_{33}x_{3} & = & b_{3},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where we use the previous notation for the coefficients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We rewrite the first two equations in the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_{11}x_{1}+a_{12}x_{2} & = & b_{1}-a_{13}x_{3},\\
a_{21}x_{1}+a_{22}x_{2} & = & b_{2}-a_{23}x_{3}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Solving these equations with respect to the unknowns 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 by using the previous formulas, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x_{1} & = & \frac{\left(b_{1}-a_{13}x_{3}\right)a_{22}-a_{12}\left(b_{2}-a_{23}x_{3}\right)}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}},\\
x_{2} & = & \frac{a_{11}\left(b_{2}-a_{23}x_{3}\right)-\left(b_{1}-a_{13}x_{3}\right)a_{12}}{a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Substituting these expressions into the last equation of the system, we
 obtain an equation determining the unknown 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

; when this equation is finally solved, we find
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{3}=\frac{a_{11}a_{22}b_{3}+a_{12}b_{2}a_{31}+b_{1}a_{21}a_{32}-a_{11}b_{2}a_{32}-a_{12}a_{21}b_{3}-b_{1}a_{22}a_{31}}{a_{11}a_{22}a_{33}+a_{12}a_{23}a_{31}+a_{13}a_{21}a_{32}-a_{11}a_{23}a_{32}-a_{12}a_{21}a_{33}-a_{13}a_{22}a_{31}}\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We now examine in detail the construction of the formula 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:1"

\end_inset

.
 First of all, we note that its numerator can be obtained from its denominator
 by substituting the constant terms 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 for the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i3}$
\end_inset

 of the unknown 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the problem is to explain the law of formation of the denominator,
 which does not contain any terms 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

, but rather is made up exclusively of the coefficients of the system.
 We write these coefficients in the form of a square array
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13}\\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}\\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}
\end{bmatrix},\label{eq:2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

preserving the order in which they appear in the system itself.
 This array has three rows and three columns, and the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ik}$
\end_inset

 are called its 
\emph on
elements
\emph default
.
 The first index gives the row in which the element appears, and the second
 index gives the column.
 Writing out the denominator
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{11}a_{22}a_{33}+a_{12}a_{23}a_{31}+a_{13}a_{21}a_{32}-a_{11}a_{23}a_{32}-a_{12}a_{21}a_{33}-a_{13}a_{22}a_{31}\label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

of the ratio 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:1"

\end_inset

, we see that it consists of six terms.
 Each term is a product of three elements from the array 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2"

\end_inset

, and in fact each term contains an element from every row and every column.
 The general form of these products is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{1p}a_{2q}a_{3r},\label{eq:4}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p,q,r$
\end_inset

 are the integers 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,3$
\end_inset

 arranged in some definite order, i.e., the first and second indices are both
 integers (from 1 to 3) and each product 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:4"

\end_inset

 contains an element from every row and every column.
 To obtain all the terms of the expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:3"

\end_inset

, the second indices 
\begin_inset Formula $p,q,r$
\end_inset

 in the product 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:4"

\end_inset

 have to be taken in all possible orders.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, there are six possible 
\emph on
permutations
\emph default
 of the second indices, namely,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
1,2,3;\quad2,3,1;\quad3,1,2;\quad1,3,2;\quad2,1,3;\quad3,2,1;\label{eq:5}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
this gives us all six terms of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:3"

\end_inset

.
 However, we see that some of the products 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:4"

\end_inset

 appear in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:3"

\end_inset

 with a plus sign, while others appear with a minus sign.
 Thus, it remains only to explain the rule by which the sign is to be chosen.
 As we see, the products 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:4"

\end_inset

 whose second indices are the permutations
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
1,2,3;\quad2,3,1;\quad3,1,2\label{eq:5a}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
appear with a 
\emph on
plus
\emph default
 sign, while the products whose second indices are the permutations
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
1,3,2;\quad2,1,3;\quad3,2,1\label{eq:5b}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
appear with a 
\emph on
minus
\emph default
 sign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now explain how the permutations in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:5a"

\end_inset

 differ from the permutations in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:5b"

\end_inset

.
 We shall call the fact that a larger number comes before a smaller number
 in a permutation an 
\emph on
inversion
\emph default
, and we shall calculate the number of inversions in the different permutations
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:5a"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first of these permutations, there are no inversions at all, i.e.,
 the number of inversions equals zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we consider the second permutation and compare the size of each number
 appearing in it with the numbers that follow.
 We see that there are two inversions here, since the numbers 2 and 3 come
 before the number 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, it can easily be seen that the third of the permutations in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:5a"

\end_inset

 also contains two inversions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can summarize this situation by saying that each of the permutations
 contains an even number of inversions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are now in a position to formulate the following sign rule for the expression
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:3"

\end_inset

: The products 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:4"

\end_inset

 for which the number of inversions in the permutations formed by the second
 indices is an 
\emph on
even
\emph default
 number appear in without any change.
 However, the products 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:4"

\end_inset

 for which the permutations formed by the second indices contain an 
\emph on
odd
\emph default
 number of inversions appear in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:3"

\end_inset

 with a 
\emph on
minus
\emph default
 sign.
 The expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:3"

\end_inset

 is called the 
\emph on
determinant
\emph default
 (of order 3) corresponding to the array 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now easily generalize these considerations and define a determinant
 of any order.
 Suppose that we are given 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{2}$
\end_inset

 numbers arranged in the form of a square array
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n}\\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}\label{eq:6}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 rows and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 columns.
 The elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ik}$
\end_inset

 of this array are certain complex numbers (or more generally from any division
 ring 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 or a field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}$
\end_inset

), and the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 indicate the row and column in which the number 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ik}$
\end_inset

 appears.
 We now take the elements of the array 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:6"

\end_inset

 and form all possible products containing one (and only one) element from
 each row and column.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These products have the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{1p_{1}}a_{2p_{2}}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot a_{np_{n}}\label{eq:7}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2},\ldots,p_{n}$
\end_inset

 is some arrangement of the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

.

, we must take all possible permutations of the second indices.
 As is well known from elementary algebra, the total number of such permutations
 equals 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 factorial, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $1\cdot2\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot n=n!$
\end_inset

 Each permutation has a certain number of inversions as compared with the
 basic arrangement 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

.
 We now ascribe signs to the products 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:7"

\end_inset

 by the following rule: We put a plus sign before products whose second
 indices form a permutation with an even number of inversions, and a minus
 sign before products whose second indices form a permutation with an odd
 number of inversions.
 The sum of all these products, with the appropriate signs, is called the
 
\emph on
determinant of order 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset


\emph default
 corresponding with the array 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:6"

\end_inset

.
 Clearly, this sum contains 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 terms.

where the summation extends over all possible permutations

 of the second indices, and the determinant of an array is indicated by
 writing the array between vertical lines.
 We note that in the expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, the factors in each product are arranged in such a way that the first
 indices occur in increasing order.
 Thus, so far, we have been concerned with the permutations formed by the
 second indices.
 However, the factors in each product can just as well be arranged in such
 a way that the second indices occur in increasing order.
 Then

 instead.

 A permutation of

\end_inset

The group 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$

 is the set of permutations of the first 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 natural numbers and is called the 
\emph on
symmetric group of degree 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We want a convenient way to represent an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The first way, is to write an element 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 as a matrix.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
3 & 1 & 5 & 4 & 2
\end{pmatrix}\in S_{5}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we write a row with 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

 at the top and right below write another row with the values 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(1),\sigma(2),\ldots,\sigma(n)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(3)=5$
\end_inset

.
 With this notation it is easy to write down products and inverses.
 For example suppose that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
3 & 1 & 5 & 4 & 2
\end{pmatrix}\qquad\tau=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
4 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 5
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
1 & 4 & 5 & 2 & 3
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

On the other hand
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma\tau=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
4 & 5 & 3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{5}$
\end_inset

 is not abelian.
 The inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is obtained by exchanging the rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with this way of representing elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 is that we don’t see much of the structure of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 this way.

Let

 The set of all permutations, under the operation of composition of permutations

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

(i) implies that the set of permutations is closed under composition of
 functions.
 We check the three axioms for a group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Associativity follows from the general fact that composition of functions
 is associative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $i:\, S\longrightarrow S$
\end_inset

 be the identity function from 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

 be a permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
i\circ f=f\circ i=f.
\]

\end_inset

Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 acts as the identity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

 be a permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

 Then the inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $g$

 by Lemma

\end_inset

(ii) and
\begin_inset Formula

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
For

 For

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 gives all possible permutations of these three elements.
 For arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 the assertion is valid for any set with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 elements, we shall show that it is also valid for every set with 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 elements.
 Thus, we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 elements give 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 permutations, and we consider any set

\end_inset

 elements, which we denote by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left\{ a_{1},\ldots,a_{n+1}\right\} .
\]

\end_inset

Consider first the permutations whose first element is 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 To obtain all possible permutations of this type, we must put 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 in the first position and then write down all possible permutations of
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 remaining elements; by assumption, the number of such permutations equals
 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 In just the same way, the number of permutations whose first element is
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{2}$
\end_inset

 also equals 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 Thus, the total number of different permutations of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},\ldots,a_{n+1}$

 equals
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Proof
Think of a permutation as just being a rearrangement of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 numbers (like a deck of cards).
 If we can find a product of transpositions, that sends this rearrangement
 back to the trivial one, then we have shown that the inverse of the correspondi
ng permutation is a product of transpositions.
 Since a transposition is its own inverse, it follows that the original
 permutation is a product of transpositions (in fact the same product, but
 in the opposite order).
 In other words if
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\tau_{k}\cdot\tau_{k-1}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\tau_{3}\cdot\tau_{2}\cdot\tau_{1}\cdot\sigma=e,\label{eq:productoftranspositions}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

then multiplying on the right by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{i}$
\end_inset

, in the opposite order, we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\tau_{1}\cdot\tau_{2}\cdot\tau_{3}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\tau_{k}.
\]

\end_inset

The idea is to put back the cards into the right position, one at a time.
 Suppose that the first 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 cards are in the right position.
 Suppose that the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th card is in position 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 As the first 
\begin_inset Formula $i-1$
\end_inset

 cards are in the right position, 
\begin_inset Formula $j\geq i$
\end_inset

.
 We may assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $j>i$
\end_inset

, otherwise there is nothing to do.
 Now look at the transposition 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

.
 This puts the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th card into the right position.
 Thus we are done by induction on 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
Any permutation can be obtained from any other permutation by performing
 transpositions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma,\tau\in S_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 From Eqn.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:productoftranspositions"

\end_inset

 in the proof of Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Lemma:Transpositions-generate-S_n"

\end_inset

 we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{k}\cdot\sigma_{k-1}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\sigma_{3}\cdot\sigma_{2}\cdot\sigma_{1}\cdot\sigma=e=\tau_{l}\cdot\tau_{l-1}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\tau_{3}\cdot\tau_{2}\cdot\tau_{1}\cdot\tau
\]

\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

's and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{j}$
\end_inset

's are transpositions.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau=\left(\tau_{1}\cdot\tau_{2}\cdot\tau_{3}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\tau_{l-1}\cdot\tau_{l}\right)\left(\sigma_{k}\cdot\sigma_{k-1}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\sigma_{3}\cdot\sigma_{2}\cdot\sigma_{1}\right)\cdot\sigma.

\begin_layout Section
Parity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that two permutations can be obtained from each other by performing
 transpositions.
 The number of transpositions needed to go from one permutation to another
 is not uniquely determined, i.e., we can go from one permutation to another
 by using different numbers of transpositions.
 However, the different numbers of transpositions needed to go from one
 permutation to the other are either all even or all odd; this can be expressed
 differently by saying that these numbers always have the same 
\emph on
parity
\emph default
.
 This is a very important result and to prove it we introduce the concept
 of inversion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Definition-Inversion-in-a-permutation"

\end_inset

By an 
\emph on
inversion
\emph default
, we mean the fact that two elements of a permutation do not appear in their
 natural order.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
Permutations in which the number of inversions is an even number will be
 called 
\emph on
even
\emph default
 permutations and those in which the number of inversions is odd will be
 called 
\emph on
odd
\emph default
 permutations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the number of inversions in the identity is zero; it is 1 in
 the transposition 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2\right)$
\end_inset

 and 3 in the transposition 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,3\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Theorem-odd-parity-change-in-inversion"

\end_inset

A transposition changes the number of inversions in a permutation by an
 odd number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Take any permutation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & \cdots & i & \cdots & j & \cdots & n\\
a_{1} & a_{2} & \cdots & a_{i} & \cdots & a_{j} & \cdots & a_{n}
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Asuume that we carry out a transposition of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 After such a transposition, the position of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1,}a_{2},\ldots,a_{i-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j+1},a_{j+2},\ldots,a_{n}$
\end_inset

 remains unchanged.
 The only thing that changes is the position of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i+1},\ldots,a_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 and, of course, the position of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 with respect to each other.
 We now calculate the total change in the number of inversions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i+1},\ldots,a_{j-1}$
\end_inset

 number 
\begin_inset Formula $j-1-i$
\end_inset

 in all.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 of these elements are in natural order with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 form inversions with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 are in natural order with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 form inversions with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p+q=r+s=j-1-i.\label{eq:a}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As a result of the transposition, a natural ordering becomes an inversion,
 and conversely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
More precisely, if before the transposition the element 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 was in natural order with respect to an intermediate element, then after
 the transposition these two elements form an inversion, and conversely.
 The same is true for the element 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Thus, the total number of inversions of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the intermediate elements is 
\begin_inset Formula $q+s$
\end_inset

 before the transposition and 
\begin_inset Formula $p+r$
\end_inset

 after the transposition, i.e., the change in the number of inversions is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta=\left(p+r\right)-\left(q+s\right).
\]

\end_inset

Using Eqn.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:a"

\end_inset

, we can rewrite this number in the form
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta=\left(p+r\right)-\left(j-1-i-p+j-1-i-r\right)=2\left(p+r-j+i-1\right)
\]

\end_inset

from which it follows at once that the number 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is even.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
It remains to consider the relative position of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 themselves.
 If they were in natural order before the transposition, then they will
 form an inversion after the transposition, and conversely, i.e., the change
 in the number of inversions in this case is equal to 1.
 Thus, the total change in the number of inversions produced by a transposition
 is an odd number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now derive some consequences of this theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Corollary-no-of-even-equals-no-of-odd"

\end_inset

The number of even permutations is equal to the number of odd permutations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
For, if we write down all 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 permutations and transpose two given elements (e.g., the elements 1 and 3)
 in every one of them, then all even permutations become odd and conversely,
 and the net effect is to get back the whole set of 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 permutations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Corollary-evenand-odd-permutations"

\end_inset

Even permutations consists of permutations which are obtained from the identity
 permutation by an even number of transpositions, while the odd permutations
 consists of permutations which are obtained from the identity permutation
 by an odd number of transpositions.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 in the sum that defines the determinant.
 Then, since the sum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}T\left(\pi\right)
\]

\end_inset

is finite, we are free to reorder the summands.
 In other words, the sum is independent of the order in which the terms
 are added, and so we can permute the term order freely without affecting
 the value of the sum.
 Some commonly used reorderings of such sums are the following:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}T\left(\pi\right) & = & \sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}T\left(\sigma\pi\right)\label{eq:1.6.1}\\
 & = & \sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}T\left(\pi\sigma\right)\label{eq:1.6.2}\\
 & = & \sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}T\left(\pi^{-1}\right)\label{eq:1.6.3}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is a fixed permutation.
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:1.6.1"

\end_inset

 follows from the fact that, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 runs through each permutation in 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 exactly once, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\pi$
\end_inset

 similarly runs through each permutation but in a potentially different
 orders i.e., the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 upon something like Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:8"

\end_inset

 is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 merely permutes the permutations that index the terms.
 Put another way, there is a one-to-one correspondence between permutations
 in general and permutations composed with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Similar reasoning holds for Equations

\begin_layout Proof
The first four properties follow directly from the definition of the determinant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
That 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(0_{n\times n}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 is obvious and 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(I_{n}\right)=1$
\end_inset

 follows because only the identity permutation contributes to the sum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Referring to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:8"

\end_inset

, we see that each term of the sum in the right-hand side contains as a
 factor one and only one element from every row and every column.
 Therefore a determinant is a linear homogeneous function of the elements
 of any row or column.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Again this is obvious from the definition.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 Then there is only one non-zero term in the sum on the rhs of

\end_inset

 viz., chose 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{11}$
\end_inset

 from the first row and first column, chose 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{22}$
\end_inset

 from the second row and second column and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since the entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}$
\end_inset

 are obtained from those of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by interchanging the row and column indices, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(A^{T}\right)$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det\left(A^{T}\right)=\sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}\sgn\left(\pi\right)a_{\pi\left(1\right)1}a_{\pi\left(2\right)2}\cdot\cdot\cdot a_{\pi\left(n\right)n}.
\]

\end_inset

Using the commutativity of the product in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}$
\end_inset

 and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sgn\left(\pi^{-1}\right)=\sgn\left(\pi\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\det\left(A^{T}\right) & = & \sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}\sgn\left(\pi^{-1}\right)a_{1\pi^{-1}\left(1\right)}a_{2\pi^{-1}\left(2\right)}\cdot\cdot\cdot a_{n\pi^{-1}\left(n\right)}\\

If a determinant has two identical rows and we interchange them, then on

 Thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(A\right)=-\det\left(A\right)$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $2\det\left(A\right)=0$

\begin_inset Formula $B=\left(b_{ij}\right),$
\end_inset

 we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\det\left(AB\right) & = & \sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}\sgn\left(\pi\right)\sum_{k_{1}=1}^{n}\cdot\cdot\cdot\sum_{k_{n}=1}^{n}a_{1k_{1}}b_{k_{1}\pi\left(1\right)}\cdot\cdot\cdot a_{nk_{n}}b_{k_{n}\pi\left(n\right)}\\

\end_inset

Note that, for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{n}\in\left\{ 1,2,\ldots,n\right\} ,$
\end_inset

 the sum 
\begin_inset Formula

\sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}\sgn\left(\pi\right)b_{k_{1}\pi\left(1\right)}\cdot\cdot\cdot b_{k_{n}\pi\left(n\right)}

is the determinant of a matrix composed of rows 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{n}$

 Thus, by property 8, it follows that this expression vanishes unless the

 In other words the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{n}\right\} $

\begin_layout Standard
Call that polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you substitute any 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{r}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the determinant, two of its rows will be the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the value of such a determinant will be 0.
 Thus it follows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left({a_{2}}\right)=f\left({a_{3}}\right)=\ldots=f\left({a_{k+1}}\right)=0.
\]

\end_inset

So 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is divisible by each of the factors 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x-a_{2},x-a_{3},\ldots,x-a_{k+1}.
\]

\end_inset

All these factors are distinct otherwise the original determinant is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left({x}\right)=C\left({x-a_{2}}\right)\left({x-a_{3}}\right)\cdots\left({x-a_{k}}\right)\left({x-a_{k+1}}\right).
\]

\end_inset

As the degree of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is no greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Since the coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{k}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{vmatrix}a_{2}^{k-1} & \cdots & a_{2}^{2} & a_{2} & 1\\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
a_{k+1}^{k-1} & \cdots & a_{k+1}^{2} & a_{k+1} & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

and, by induction hypothesis, this is equal to
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\displaystyle \prod_{2\mathop\le i\mathop<j\mathop\le k+1}\left({a_{i}-a_{j}}\right)}
\]

\end_inset

so this has to be the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\displaystyle f\left({x}\right)=\left({x-a_{2}}\right)\left({x-a_{3}}\right)\cdots\left({x-a_{k}}\right)\left({x-a_{k+1}}\right)\prod_{2\mathop\le i\mathop<j\mathop\le k+1}\left({a_{i}-a_{j}}\right)}.
\]

\end_inset

Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, we retrieve the proposition 
\begin_inset Formula $P(k+1)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left({k}\right)\implies P\left({k+1}\right)$
\end_inset

 and the result follows by the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\displaystyle V_{n}=\prod_{1\mathop\le i\mathop<j\mathop\le n}\left({a_{i}-a_{j}}\right)}.

Matrices

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we define matrices with its main operations, and we study
 various matrices formed from groups and rings.
 The English mathematician James Joseph Sylvester invented the term ``Matrix''
 in the year 1850.
 The defined matrix operations introduced by Sylvester were considered by
 Arthur Cayley in 1858, when he in his article ``A memoir on the theory
 of matrices'' for the first time considered matrices as independent algebraic
 objects .
 For us matrices form the central approach to the theory of linear algebra.

 These ``empty matrices'' we denote with

 They are needed in some proofs for technical reasons.
 However, when we later speak of algebraic structures as matrix groups or

\end_inset

Note that the matrix multiplication is not commutative in general!

On the other hand

\begin_layout Example
Insurance companies calculate the premiums payable by its customers, the
 so-called insurance premiums on the insured risk, the higher the risk,
 the higher the premium.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
The key to business success and the insurer is the identification and evaluation
 of factors contributing to an increased risk.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
In the case of car insurance among the possible factors are such as the
 annual driving performance, the distance between home and work, family
 status, the sex or the age of the driver or , but also the model, the engine
 performance or even the color of the vehicle.
 The customer must prior to contracting his insurance provide information
 on some, sometimes to tell all of these factors.
 Considered the best indicator of the occurrence of cases of damage by a
 customer in the future is the number of its claims in the past.
 To put this into the premium calculation involved, there is the system
 of ``claims classes''.
 In this system the insured are divided into relatively homogeneous risk
 groups whose premiums relative to their risk is determined by the loss
 record.
 Whoever in the past had few claims is given a discount on his premium.
 Needed for the mathematical description of a system of claims categories
 is a set of such classes, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ K1,\ldots,Kn\right\} $
\end_inset

, and a transition rule between the classes.
 It should be that 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{1}$
\end_inset

 the ``entry level'' comes with the highest contribution and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{n}$
\end_inset

 the class with the lowest contribution, i.e., the highest discount rate.
 The discount is usually a percentage of the ``entry fee'' specified.
 We consider a simple example where there are 4 classes:

 Suppose for simplicity that the probability (exactly) of any claim for
 each insured is 0.1 (ie 10%) and the probability of two or more claims is
 0.05 (5%).
 (In practice, the insurers decide these probabilities, and of course, depend
 on the respective classes.) Consider for example the following:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{11}=0.15,\, p_{12}=0.85,\, p_{13}=0.00,\: p_{14}=0.00.

\end_inset

 Whoever is this year in class 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{1}$

 Finally, there is no possibility of a person in class

 this year moves to one of the classes 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{3}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{4}$

\begin_inset Formula $p_{ij},\, i,j=1,2,3,4$

All entries of this matrix are non-negative real numbers and the sum of
 all entries in each line is equal to 1.00.
 Such a matrix is called a

Suppose the insurer has this year following distribution of customers in
 the four claims categories: 40% of customers are in class 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{1}$

\end_inset

, 20% in class 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 10% in class 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{4}$
\end_inset

 Then the distribution of customers can be represented by a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times4$
\end_inset

 matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{0}=\begin{bmatrix}0.4 & 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.1\end{bmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

and the distribution next year is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
p_{0}\star P & = & \begin{bmatrix}0.4 & 0.3 & 0.2 & 0.1\end{bmatrix}\star\begin{bmatrix}0.15 & 0.85 & 0.00 & 0.00\\

0.05 & 0.10 & 0.00 & 0.85\\
0.05 & 0.00 & 0.10 & 0.85
\end{bmatrix}\\
 & = & \begin{bmatrix}0.12 & 0.36 & 0.265 & 0.255\end{bmatrix}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Why is that? As an example, consider the entry (1,4): it is calculated as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{1}=0.4\times0.00+0.3\times0.00+0.2\times0.85+0.1\times0.85=0.255.
\]

\end_inset

This entry represents the percentage of customers that in the next year
 will be in class 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{4}$
\end_inset

 (these are therefore 25.5%).
 Those who are this year in class 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{1}$
\end_inset

 and class 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{2}$
\end_inset

 , may in following year not come into 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{4}$
\end_inset

, so we multiply the output distributions 0.4 and 0.3 with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{14}=0.00$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{24}=0.00$
\end_inset

.
 Those in class 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{3}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{4}$
\end_inset

 will be in class 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{4}$
\end_inset

 in the following year with probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{34}=0.85$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{44}=0.85$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 This results is the products 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2\times0.85$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.1\times0.85$
\end_inset

.

\end_inset

The formula is also valid for

\begin_inset Formula $P^{0}=I_{4}$

Using this formula, the insurer may now calculate the expected premium income
 in the coming years.
 In this regard it assumed that the full premium (class

 30000.
 the premiums in grades 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{2},K_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{4}$
\end_inset

 are then 27000, 24000 and 18000 rupees (10, 20 and 40% Discount).
 If, for example, in the base year 1000 customers are insured, resulting
 in this year, premium income (in rupees) of
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1000\cdot\left(p_{0}\star\left[30000,27000,24000,300\right]^{T}\right)=26700000.
\]

\end_inset

The expected income in the year 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge0$
\end_inset

 according to this model from the contracts in the base year (if no client
 has terminated in the meantime) are then given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1000\cdot\left(p_{0}\star P^{n}\star\left[30000,27000,24000,300\right]^{T}\right).

The amounts fall from year to year.
 Is there a ``steady state'', i.e., a point in time at which the revenue does
 not change? Which properties of the system would imply the existence of
 such a steady state? Obviously, these are important practical issues that
 the insurer must answer.
 Only the secure existence a steady state also guarantees a significant
 premium income in the future.
 Since the formula for the future premium income mainly derives from the
 entries of the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{n}$
\end_inset

 depends, we are immediately led to an interesting problem in linear algebra,
 namely the analysis of the properties of stochastic matrices.

 Because of Lemma

 the map

\begin_layout Standard
Now we come to the question of whether and when matrices are invertiblewith
 respect to multiplication .
 To have a multiplicative inverse for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 means existence of a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $A\star B=I=B\star A$
\end_inset

.
 For this to even be possible we must have that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 must be square to begin with.
 The definition of invertible matrices is thus limited to the square matrices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
A matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

 is said to be 
\emph on
invertible
\emph default
, if there exists a matrx 
\begin_inset Formula $B\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $A\star B=I_{n}=B\star A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

 are invertible.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

 the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0\right]$
\end_inset

 is not invertible if 
\begin_inset Formula $1\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 For a more interesting example consider a ring where 
\begin_inset Formula $1\neq0$
\end_inset

 then the matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}\in R^{2,2}
\]

\end_inset

is not invertible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to keep in mind that if 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

 is invertible then the inverse must also be an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, for example for the matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\
0 & 2
\end{bmatrix}\in\mathbf{Z}^{2,2}
\]

\end_inset

there is a matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B=\begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{rr}
1 & -\frac{1}{2}\\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{array}\end{bmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

with the property 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\star B=I_{2}=B\star A
\]

\end_inset

but 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $B\not\in\mathbf{Z}^{2,2}$
\end_inset

 
\series default
though 
\begin_inset Formula $B\in\mathbf{Q}^{2,2}$
\end_inset

 so 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 as an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Q}^{2,2}$
\end_inset

 is invertible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also important to note that 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge2$
\end_inset

 has non-trivial zero divisors.
 i.e., there are matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in R^{n,n}\setminus\left\{ 0\right\} $
\end_inset

, for which there is a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B\in R^{n,n}\setminus\left\{ 0\right\} $
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $A\star B=0$
\end_inset

 there.
 For example, in 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{2,2}$
\end_inset

 consider the equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}\star\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0\\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Here, then, in particular 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{2}=0$
\end_inset

, although 
\begin_inset Formula $A\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Note that this identity also holds if 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is an integral domain.
 The existence of non-trivial zero divisors shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

, for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge2$
\end_inset

 can not be an integral domain, even if 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is a field (this also follows from the noncommutativity of matrix multiplicatio
n).
 However, the following theorem holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset Formula $\left(R^{n,n},+,\star\right)$
\end_inset

 is a (non-commutative) ring with the identity element 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We have already shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $(R^{n,n},+)$
\end_inset

 is a commutative group (Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Thm:Matrix-Group"

\end_inset

 The other properties (associativity, distributivity and identity element)

The set of invertible matrices

 group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The closure of the set of invertible matrices

\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Thm:Group-of-Triangular-Matrices"

\end_inset

The set of invertible upper triangular matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

 and the invertible lower triangular matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

 respectively forms a (non-commutative) subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $GL_{n}(R)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We prove the assertion only for invertible upper triangular matrices.
 The proof for invertible lower triangular is analogous.
 To show that the invertible upper triangular with the matrix multiplication
 form a subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $GL_{n}(R)$
\end_inset

, we verify the three properties of a group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The identity matriox 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}$
\end_inset

 is an invertible upper triangular matrix, so the set of invertible upper
 triangular matrices is a nonempty subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $GL_{n}(R)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now we show that for any two invertible upper triangular matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

 the product 
\begin_inset Formula $C=A\star B$
\end_inset

 is an invertible upper triangular matrix.
 The invertibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\left[c_{ij}\right]$
\end_inset

 follows from (2) in Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Lemma:Matrix-Inverse"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
For 
\begin_inset Formula $i>j$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
c_{ij} & = & \sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{ik}b_{kj}\qquad\textrm{(here }b_{kj}=0\textrm{ for }k>j\textrm{)}\\
 & = & \sum_{k=1}^{j}a_{ik}b_{kj}\qquad\textrm{(here }a_{ik}=0\textrm{ for }k=1,\ldots,j,\textrm{ if }i>j\textrm{)}\\
 & = & 0.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is upper triangular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Next we show that for a given upper triangular invertible matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, the inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is also an upper triangular matrix.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

 the statement is trivial, Therefore, we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge2$
\end_inset

.
 We write 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}=\left[c_{ij}\right]$
\end_inset

, then the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $A\star A^{-1}=I_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be write the form of a system of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 equations as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{1n}\\
0 & a_{22} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{2n}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & a_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}\star\begin{bmatrix}c_{1j}\\
c_{2j}\\
\vdots\\
c_{nj}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\delta_{1j}\\
\delta_{2j}\\
\vdots\\
\delta_{nj}
\end{bmatrix},\quad j=1,\ldots,n.\label{eq:2.3.1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the Kronecker delta function.
 We have to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i>j$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We claim (and show inductively): The diagonal entries 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ii}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are invertible and for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=n,n-1\ldots,1$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c_{ij}=a_{ii}^{-1}\left(\delta_{ij}-\sum_{l=i+1}^{n}a_{il}c_{lj}\right),\quad j=1,\ldots,n.\label{eq:2.3.2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i>j$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
(Note that in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2.3.2"

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=n$
\end_inset

, we have the empty sum which by convention is 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
From the last equation in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2.3.1"

\end_inset

 we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{nn}c_{nj}=\delta_{nj},\quad j=1,\ldots,n.
\]

\end_inset

In particular for 
\begin_inset Formula $j=n$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{nn}c_{nn}=1=c_{nn}a_{nn}$
\end_inset

 which implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{nn}$
\end_inset

 is invertible.
 Here we have used the commutativity of the ring 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 It then follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{nj}=a_{nn}^{-1}\delta_{nj}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,\ldots,n-1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2.3.2"

\end_inset

 is established for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now suppose that our assertion for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=n,\ldots,k+1$
\end_inset

 holds, where 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le k\le n-1$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, in particular 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1\le i\le n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $i>j$
\end_inset

.
 In other words: The rows 
\begin_inset Formula $i=n,...,k+1$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 are in ``upper triangular form.'' To prove the statement, for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=k$
\end_inset

, we consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-th row in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2.3.1"

\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{kk}c_{kj}+a_{k,k+1}c_{k+1,j}+\cdots+a_{kn}c_{nj}=\delta_{kj},\quad j=1,\ldots,n.\label{eq:2.3.3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $j=k\,(<n)$
\end_inset

 we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{kk}c_{kk}+a_{k,k+1}c_{k+1,k}+\cdots+a_{kn}c_{nk}=1.
\]

\end_inset

By the induction hypothesis 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k+1,k}=\cdots=c_{nk}=0,$
\end_inset

 thus 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{kk}c_{kk}=1=c_{kk}a_{kk}$
\end_inset

 where we have used the commutativity of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{kk}$
\end_inset

 is invertible with 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{kk}=a_{kk}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 It now follows from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2.3.3"

\end_inset

 that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{kj}=a_{kk}^{-1}\left(\delta_{kj}-a_{k,k+1}c_{k+1,j}-\cdots-a_{kn}c_{nj}\right),\quad j=1,\ldots,n
\]

\end_inset

which is 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2.3.2"

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=k$
\end_inset

.
 If further 
\begin_inset Formula $k>j$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{kj}=0$
\end_inset

 and also 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k+1,j}=\cdots=c_{nj}=0$
\end_inset

 it follows 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{kj}=0.$
\end_inset

 The proof is complete by induction.

\begin_layout Theorem

name "Thm:Group-of-Permutations"

\end_inset

The set of permutation matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $P\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

, w.r.t the matrix multiplication is a (non-commutative) subgroup of 
\begin_inset Formula $GL_{n}(R)$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $P\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

 is a permutation matrix, then 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is invertible and we have 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{-1}=P^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let  
\begin_inset Formula $P=\left[p_{ij}\right]\in R^{n,n}$
\end_inset

 be a permutation matrix, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $P\star P^{T}=C=\left[c_{ij}\right]$
\end_inset

, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}p_{ik}p_{jk}=\delta_{ij}.
\]

\end_inset

Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $C=I_{n}$
\end_inset

 and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{T}\star P=I_{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The permutation matrices therefore form a (non-empty) subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $GL_{n}(R)$

 and the inverse of any permutation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the transposed matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{T}$

 Finally it remains to show that the product of two permutation matrices
 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1},P_{2}\in R^{n,n}$

 is also a permutation matrix.
 This can be seen immediately from the fact that there is exactly one entry
 equal to 1 in each row and column of

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{2}$

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many applications, one is interested in whether a (square) matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is invertible and you may well wish to compute the inverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 or solve a linear systems of equations with the coefficient matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 In this chapter, we will develop a systematic method that for an invertible
 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, which is defined over a field, the inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is obtained as a product of the so-called elementary matrices.
 If these elementary matrices from are multiplied on the left of the matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, one therefore obtains the identity matrix.
 Applied to a non-invertible matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 does not result in the identity matrix, but results in a matrix, ,that
 is ``as close to'' to the unit matrix, in a certain sense.
 The term rank of matrices is motivated, which in linear algebra is of great
 importance and occurs frequently occur in later chapters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Elementary Matrices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 be a commutative ring with identity, let 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}$
\end_inset

 be the identity matrix and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\e_{i}$
\end_inset

be the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th column of 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}=\left[\e_{1},\ldots,\e_{n}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $i,\, j\in\mathbf{N}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le i,\, j\le n$
\end_inset

 we define the matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{ij}:=\left[0,\ldots,0,\underbrace{\ \e_{i}\ }_{\text{Column }j},0,\ldots,0\right]
\]

\end_inset

i.e., the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(i,\, j\right)$
\end_inset

 element of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is 1, all other elements are 0.
 In the following three definitions of 
\emph on
Elementary Matrices
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 will denote natural numbers between 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $i<j$
\end_inset

 we define the matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{ij}=\left[\e_{1},\ldots,\e_{i-1},\e_{j},\e_{i+1},\ldots,\e_{j-1},\e_{i},\e_{j+1},\ldots,\e_{n}\right]\in R^{n,n}.\label{eq:permutation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

We have seen that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is a permutation matrix.
 It has the property that on left multiplication on a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in R^{n,m}$
\end_inset

 results in the exchange of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-th rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in R$
\end_inset

 we define the matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M_{i}\left(\lambda\right):=\left[\e_{1},\ldots,\e_{i-1},\lambda\e_{i},\e_{i+1},\ldots,\e_{n}\right]\in R^{n,n}.\label{eq:Mult-by-lambda}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th column of 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\e_{i}.$
\end_inset

 Obviously 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 is a diagonal matrix with the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th diagonal element 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and all other diagonal elements 1.
 Multiplying a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in R^{n,m}$
\end_inset

 on the left with 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 results in the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th row of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 being multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally if 
\begin_inset Formula $n\ge2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i<j$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in R$
\end_inset

, we define the matrix
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G_{ij}\left(\lambda\right):=I_{n}+\lambda\cdot E_{ji}=\left[\e_{1},\ldots,\e_{i-1},\e_{i}+\lambda\e_{j},\e_{i+1},\ldots,\e_{n}\right]\in R^{n,n}.\label{eq:Add-j-th-row-to-i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th column of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ij}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\e_{i}+\lambda\e_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ij}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 is a lower triangular matrix because we are assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $i<j$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiplying a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in R^{n,m}$
\end_inset

 on left with such a lower triangular matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $Gij\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

, results in adding 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 times the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th row of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-th row of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 The multiplication from the left with the upper triangular matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ij}^{T}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 causes 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 times the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-th row of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to be added to the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th row of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 For example:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\
4 & 5 & 6\\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix},\quad G_{23}\left(-1\right)=\left[\e_{1},\e_{2}-\e_{3},\e_{3}\right]=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & -1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{23}\left(-1\right)A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\
4 & 5 & 6\\
3 & 3 & 3
\end{bmatrix},\quad G_{23}^{T}\left(-1\right)A=\begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 2 & 3\\
-3 & -3 & -3\\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{array}\end{bmatrix}.

\begin_layout Lemma
(3) 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ij}^{-1}\left(\lambda\right)=G_{ij}\left(-\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
(1) The invertibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{ij}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{ij}^{-1}=P_{ij}^{T}$
\end_inset

 was proved in Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Thm:Group-of-Permutations"

\end_inset

.
 The symmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
(2) This follows from Corollary 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Cor:Invertible-Diagonal-Matrices"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
(3) We have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
G_{ij}\left(\lambda\right)G_{ij}\left(-\lambda\right) & = & \left(I_{n}+\lambda\cdot E_{ji}\right)\left(I_{n}+\left(-\lambda\right)\cdot E_{ji}\right)\\
 & = & I_{n}+\lambda\cdot E_{ji}+\left(-\lambda\right)\cdot E_{ji}+\left(-\lambda^{2}\right)\cdot E_{ji}^{2}\\
 & = & I_{n}\\
 & = & G_{ij}\left(-\lambda\right)G_{ij}\left(\lambda\right).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Here we have used 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{ji}^{2}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i<j$
\end_inset

 which follows because
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E_{ji}\e_{k} & = & 0\ \text{if }k\neq i\\
E_{ji}\e_{i} & = & \e_{j}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{ji}^{2}\e_{k}=0\ \text{for all }k.
\]

We will now use the elementary matrices to investigate the invertibility

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constructive proof of the following theorem is based on the 
\emph on

\emph default
, in which for each matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathbb{F}^{n,m}$
\end_inset

 is constructed a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B\in GL_{n}(\mathbb{F})$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $BA=C$
\end_inset

 is a (uniquely determined) 
\emph on

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is invertible if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $C=I_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B=A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 We achieve the echelon form by left multiplication of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by elementary matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{ij},\, M_{ij}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ij}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 Each of these left multiplications corresponds to the application one of
 the so-called ``elementary row operations'' on the matrix

We assume that

 is a matrix over a field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}$
\end_inset

 (and not a ring 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

), for in the following proof, we need all the time that non-zero entries

Let

 Then there are (invertible) matrices

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\star$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 More precisely, 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\left[c_{ij}\right]$
\end_inset

 is either the zero matrix or there is a sequence of natural numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{1},\ldots,j_{r}$
\end_inset

 (the ``steps'' of the staircase normal form), where

More generally, for any (left) right module

 over a ring

 as a subset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 spans 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

 However, unlike bases for a vector space, bases for a module may not have
 the same cardinality.

\begin_layout Theorem
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 be a vector space over a field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}$
\end_inset

.
 Every linearly independent subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 can be extended to a basis for 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be a linearly independent subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 be the collection of all linearly independent supersets of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 First, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 is non-empty since 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}\subseteq A_{2}\subseteq\cdots$
\end_inset

 is a chain of linearly independent supersets of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, then their union is again a linearly independent superset of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
So by Zorn's Lemma, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 has a maximal element 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\operatorname{span}(B)$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $W\ne V$
\end_inset

, pick 
\begin_inset Formula $b\in V-W$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0=rb+r_{1}b_{1}+\cdots+r_{n}b_{n},
\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}\in B$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $-rb=r_{1}b_{1}+\cdots+r_{n}b_{n}$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $-rb\in\operatorname{span}(B)=W$
\end_inset

.
 But 
\begin_inset Formula $b\notin W$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $b\ne0$
\end_inset

, which implies 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

.
 Consequently 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}=\cdots=r_{n}=0$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
 As a result, 
\begin_inset Formula $B\cup\lbrace b\rbrace$
\end_inset

 is a linearly independent superset of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

, contradicting the maximality of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$

\begin_layout Proposition
Every spanning set of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be a spanning set of

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 be the collection of all linearly independent subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 is non-empty as 
\begin_inset Formula $\varnothing\in\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}\subseteq A_{2}\subseteq\cdots$
\end_inset

 be a chain of linearly independent subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Then the union of these sets is again a linearly independent subset of
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Therefore, by Zorn's lemma, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 has a maximal element 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is a linearly independent subset 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $W=\operatorname{span}(B)$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $W\ne V$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 spans 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, there is an element 
\begin_inset Formula $b\in A$
\end_inset

 not in 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 (for otherwise the span of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 must lie in 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

, which would imply 
\begin_inset Formula $W=V$
\end_inset

).
 Then, using the same argument as in the previous proposition, 
\begin_inset Formula $B\cup\lbrace b\rbrace$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent, which contradicts the maximality of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 spans 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and thus a basis for 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
Every vector space has a basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Either take 
\begin_inset Formula $\varnothing$
\end_inset

 to be the linearly independent subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and apply proposition 1, or take 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 to be the spanning subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$

 The two propositions above can be combined into one: If

\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_layout Section
Change of basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 be a vector space.
 Given a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, each vector 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in V$
\end_inset

 can be uniquely expressed in terms of the base elements 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}\in A$
\end_inset

 as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v=\sum_{v_{i}\in A}r_{i}v_{i}
\]

\end_inset

where the sum is taken over a finite number of elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose now that 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is another basis for 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 By a 
\emph on
change of basis
\emph default
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 we mean re-expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 in terms of base elements 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}\in B$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formally, we can think of a change of basis as the identity function (viewed
 as a linear operator) on a vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, such that elements in the domain are expressed in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and elements in the range are expressed in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, by the very design of a basis, a change of basis in a vector
 space is always possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, if 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 has dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $n<\infty$
\end_inset

.
 We can total order bases 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 Then a change of basis (from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

) has the matrix representation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[I\right]_{B}^{A},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $I\,:\, V\to V$
\end_inset

 is the identity operator.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{B}^{A}$
\end_inset

 is called a 
\emph on
change of basis matrix
\emph default
.
 By applying 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{B}^{A}$
\end_inset

 to a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 expressed in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 expressed in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[v\right]_{B}=\left[I\right]_{B}^{A}\left[v\right]_{A},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[v\right]_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[v\right]_{B}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 expressed in the two bases 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 is obviously invertible, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{B}^{A}$
\end_inset

 is invertible also, whose inverse is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{B}^{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, 
\begin_inset Formula $[I]_{A}=I_{n}$
\end_inset

 for any basis 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the identity matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\mathbf{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and the following two sets 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\left\{ \begin{pmatrix}1\\
-1\\
2
\end{pmatrix},\,\begin{pmatrix}0\\
1\\
1
\end{pmatrix},\,\begin{pmatrix}2\\
3\\
0
\end{pmatrix}\right\} \quad\mbox{ and}\quad B=\left\{ \begin{pmatrix}1\\
0\\
0
\end{pmatrix},\,\begin{pmatrix}0\\
1\\
0
\end{pmatrix},\,\begin{pmatrix}0\\
0\\
1
\end{pmatrix}\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

be the two ordered bases for 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, ordered in the way the elements are arranged in the set.
 For each 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}\in A$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $I\left(v_{i}\right)=v_{i}=\left[v_{i}\right]_{E_{3}}$
\end_inset

, we see that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[I\right]_{B}^{A}=\begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 0 & 2\\
-1 & 1 & 3\\
2 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

Notice that the columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{B}^{A}$
\end_inset

 are exactly the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, each element of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
already
\emph default
 written in terms of the standard basis elements (in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

).
 For example, let 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 be the first basis element in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Let us see what 
\begin_inset Formula $[v]_{A}$
\end_inset

 is, when expressed using base elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, the standard ordered basis: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[v\right]_{B}=\left[I\right]_{B}^{A}\left[v\right]_{A}=\begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 0 & 2\\
-1 & 1 & 3\\
2 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\end{pmatrix}\left[v\right]_{A}=\begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 0 & 2\\
-1 & 1 & 3\\
2 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1\\
0\\
0
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{r}
1\\
-1\\
2
\end{array}\end{pmatrix},
\]

\end_inset

exactly as we have expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, let 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 be the first basis element in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 What is 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 when expressed in terms of basis elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

? In other words, we need to find 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[w\right]_{A}=\left[I\right]_{A}^{B}\left[w\right]_{B}.
\]

\end_inset

Now, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[w\right]_{B}$
\end_inset

 is just 
\begin_inset Formula $\begin{pmatrix}1\\
0\\
0
\end{pmatrix}$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[w\right]_{A}$
\end_inset

 is nothing more than the first column of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{A}^{B}$
\end_inset

, which is just the inverse of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{A}^{B}$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[I\right]_{A}^{B}=\left(\left[I\right]_{A}^{B}\right)^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 2\\
-1 & 1 & 3\\
2 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{rrr}
{\displaystyle \frac{1}{3}} & -{\displaystyle \frac{2}{9}} & {\displaystyle \frac{2}{9}}\\
-{\displaystyle \frac{2}{3}} & {\displaystyle \frac{4}{9}} & {\displaystyle \frac{5}{9}}\\
{\displaystyle \frac{1}{3}} & {\displaystyle \frac{1}{9}} & -{\displaystyle \frac{1}{9}}
\end{array}\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[w\right]_{A}=\begin{pmatrix}{\displaystyle \frac{1}{3}}\\
-{\displaystyle \frac{2}{3}}\\
{\displaystyle \frac{1}{3}}
\end{pmatrix}$
\end_inset

.
 A quick verification shows that this is indeed the case: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}1\\
0\\
0
\end{pmatrix}=\frac{1}{3}\begin{pmatrix}1\\
-1\\
2
\end{pmatrix}-\frac{2}{3}\begin{pmatrix}0\\
1\\
1
\end{pmatrix}+\frac{1}{3}\begin{pmatrix}2\\
3\\
0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 be the set 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\{ \begin{pmatrix}1\\

2
\end{pmatrix},\,\begin{pmatrix}0\\
1\\
1
\end{pmatrix},\,\begin{pmatrix}2\\
1\\
0
\end{pmatrix}\right\} .
\]

\end_inset

 It is easy to check that 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 forms a basis for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 (determinant is non-zero).
 Order 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in the obvious manner.
 What is the change of basis matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{A}^{C}$
\end_inset

? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way is to express each element of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in terms of the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Another way is to use the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{A}^{C}=\left[I\right]_{A}^{B}\left[I\right]_{B}^{C}$
\end_inset

.
 Applying the first example, we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[I\right]_{B}^{C}$
\end_inset

 is just the matrix whose columns are elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 As a result: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[I\right]_{A}^{C}=\left[I\right]_{A}^{B}\left[I\right]_{B}^{C}=\begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{rrr}
{\displaystyle \frac{1}{3}} & -{\displaystyle \frac{2}{9}} & {\displaystyle \frac{2}{9}}\\
-{\displaystyle \frac{2}{3}} & {\displaystyle \frac{4}{9}} & {\displaystyle \frac{5}{9}}\\
{\displaystyle \frac{1}{3}} & {\displaystyle \frac{1}{9}} & -{\displaystyle \frac{1}{9}}
\end{array}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & 2\\
0 & 1 & 1\\
2 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}7/9 & 0 & 4/9\\
4/9 & 1 & -8/9\\
1/9 & 0 & 7/9
\end{pmatrix}.

\begin_layout Theorem
The sum of the rank and the nullity of a linear mapping gives the dimension
 of the mapping's domain.
 More precisely, let 
\begin_inset Formula $T\,:\, V\longrightarrow W$
\end_inset

 be a linear mapping.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is a finite-dimensional, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\dim V=\dim\mathop{\mathrm{Ker}}T+\dim\mathop{\mathrm{Img}}T.
\]

\end_inset

 Every independent linear constraint takes away one degree of freedom.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rank is just the number of independent linear constraints on 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in V$
\end_inset

 imposed by the equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T(v)=0.
\]

\end_inset

The dimension of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is the number of unconstrained degrees of freedom.
 The nullity is the degrees of freedom in the resulting space of solutions.
 To put it yet another way:

\begin_layout Proof
The images of a basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 will span 
\begin_inset Formula $\Img T$
\end_inset

, and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\Img T$
\end_inset

 is finite-dimensional.
 Choose then a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1},\ldots,w_{n}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Img T$
\end_inset

 and choose preimages 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}\in U$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{i}=T(v_{i}),\quad i=1\ldots n
\]

\end_inset

Choose a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},\ldots,u_{k}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Ker T$
\end_inset

.
 The result will follow once we show that 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},\ldots,u_{k},v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}$
\end_inset

 is a basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in V$
\end_inset

 be given.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $T(v)\in\Img T$
\end_inset

, by definition, we can choose scalars 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{1},\ldots,b_{n}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T(v)=b_{1}w_{1}+\cdots+b_{n}w_{n}.
\]

\end_inset

Linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 now implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $T(b_{1}v_{1}+\ldots+b_{n}v_{n}-v)=0,$
\end_inset

 and hence we can choose scalars 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},\ldots,a_{k}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b_{1}v_{1}+\ldots+b_{n}v_{n}-v=a_{1}u_{1}+\cdots+a_{k}u_{k}.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},\ldots,u_{k},v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}$
\end_inset

 span 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Next, let 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},\ldots,a_{k},b_{1},\ldots,b_{n}$
\end_inset

 be scalars such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{1}u_{1}+\cdots+a_{k}u_{k}+b_{1}v_{1}+\cdots+b_{n}v_{n}=0.
\]

\end_inset

By applying 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 to both sides of this equation it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b_{1}w_{1}+\cdots+b_{n}w_{n}=0,
\]

\end_inset

and since 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1},\ldots,w_{n}$
\end_inset

 are linearly independent that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b_{1}=b_{2}=\cdots=b_{n}=0.
\]

\end_inset

Consequently 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{1}u_{1}+\cdots+a_{k}u_{k}=0
\]

\end_inset

as well, and since 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},\ldots,u_{k}$
\end_inset

 are also assumed to be linearly independent we conclude that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdots=a_{k}=0
\]

\end_inset

also.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1},\ldots,u_{k},v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}$
\end_inset

 are linearly independent, and are therefore a basis.

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 be a vector space over a field 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\emph on
dual
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vstar$
\end_inset

, is the vector space of linear forms on 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 linear mappings 
\begin_inset Formula $V\to k$
\end_inset

.
 The operations in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vstar$
\end_inset

 are defined pointwise: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(\varphi+\psi)(v)=\varphi(v)+\psi(v)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(\lambda\varphi)(v)=\lambda\varphi(v)
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in K$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi,\psi\in\Vstar$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vstar$
\end_inset

 if and only if the dimension of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is finite.
 If not, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vstar$
\end_inset

 has a larger (infinite) dimension than 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

; in other words, the cardinal of any basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vstar$
\end_inset

 is strictly greater than the cardinal of any basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even when 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is finite-dimensional, there is no canonical or natural isomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $V\longrightarrow\Vstar$
\end_inset

.
 But on the other hand, a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\B$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 does define a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\Bstar$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vstar$
\end_inset

, and moreover a bijection 
\begin_inset Formula $\B\longrightarrow\Bstar$
\end_inset

.
 For suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\B=\left\{ b_{1},\dots,b_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 For each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, define a mapping 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta_{i}\,:\, V\longrightarrow k
\]

\end_inset

by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta_{i}\left(\sum_{k}x_{k}b_{k}\right))=x_{i}.
\]

\end_inset

It is easy to see that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 are nonzero elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vstar$
\end_inset

 and are independent.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \beta_{1},\dots,\beta_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vstar$
\end_inset

, called the dual basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $\B$

 a very simple canonical injection 
\begin_inset Formula $V\longrightarrow\Vstarstar$
\end_inset

 To see it, let

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $x'$

\begin_inset Formula $x\longmapsto x'$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\Vstarstar$

\begin_layout Definition
A linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $P\,:\, V\longrightarrow V$
\end_inset

 of a vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is called a 
\emph on
projection
\emph default
 if it acts like the identity on its image.
 This condition can be more succinctly expressed by the equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P^{2}=P.\label{eq:proj}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
If 
\begin_inset Formula $P\,\colon\, V\longrightarrow V$
\end_inset

 is a projection, then its image and the kernel are complementary subspaces,
 namely 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V=\ker P\oplus\img P.\label{eq:comp}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is a projection.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in V$
\end_inset

 be given, and set 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u=v-Pv.
\]

\end_inset

The projection condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:proj"

\end_inset

 then implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in\ker P$
\end_inset

, and we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 as the sum of an image and kernel vectors: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v=u+Pv.
\]

\end_inset

This decomposition is unique, because the intersection of the image and
 the kernel is the trivial subspace.
 Indeed, suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in V$
\end_inset

 is in both the image and the kernel of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $Pv=v$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Pv=0$
\end_inset

, and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $v=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, every direct sum decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V=V_{1}\oplus V_{2}
\]

\end_inset

corresponds to a projection 
\begin_inset Formula $P\,\colon\, V\longrightarrow V$
\end_inset

 defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Pv=\begin{cases}
v & \textrm{if }v\in V_{1}\\
0 & \textrm{if }v\in V_{2}.
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specializing somewhat, suppose that the ground field is 
\begin_inset Formula $\reals$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\cnums$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is equipped with a positive-definite inner product.
 In this setting we call an endomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $P\,\colon\, V\longrightarrow V$
\end_inset

 an 
\emph on
orthogonal projection
\emph default
 if it is self-dual 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\adj=P,
\]

\end_inset

in addition to satisfying the projection condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:proj"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
The kernel and image of an orthogonal projection are orthogonal subspaces.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $u\in\ker P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in\img P$
\end_inset

 be given.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is self-dual we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
0=\langle Pu,v\rangle=\langle u,Pv\rangle=\langle u,v\rangle.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we see that a orthogonal projection 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 projects a 
\begin_inset Formula $v\in V$
\end_inset

 onto 
\begin_inset Formula $Pv$
\end_inset

 in an orthogonal fashion, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\langle v-Pv,u\rangle=0

\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mM$
\end_inset

 be an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $j\supth$
\end_inset

 column is represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i}M_{ij}\be_{i}$
\end_inset

; whence using multilinearity 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\det(\mM) & =\det\sum_{i}M_{i1}\be_{i}\,,\sum_{i}M_{i2}\be_{i}\,,\;\ldots\;,\sum_{i}M_{in}\be_{i}\\
 & =\sum_{i_{1},\ldots,i_{n}=1}^{n}M_{i_{1}1}M_{i_{2}2}\cdots M_{i_{n}n}\det(\be_{i_{1}},\be_{i_{2}},\ldots,\be_{i_{n}})
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The anti-symmetry assumption implies that the expressions 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(\be_{i_{1}},\be_{i_{2}},\ldots,\be_{i_{n}})$
\end_inset

 vanish if any two of the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1},\ldots,i_{n}$
\end_inset

 coincide.
 If all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 indices are distinct, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det(\be_{i_{1}},\be_{i_{2}},\ldots,\be_{i_{n}})=\pm\det(\be_{1},\ldots,\be_{n}),
\]

\end_inset

the sign in the above expression being determined by the number of transposition
s required to rearrange the list 
\begin_inset Formula $(i_{1},\ldots,i_{n})$
\end_inset

 into the list 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,\ldots,n)$
\end_inset

.
 The sign is therefore the parity of the permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $(i_{1},\ldots,i_{n})$
\end_inset

.
 Since we also assume that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det(\be_{1},\ldots,\be_{n})=1,
\]

\end_inset

we now recover the original definition

\begin_layout Section
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should all know about the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix,
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 To calculate the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, one subtracts a variable, say 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, from the diagonal entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, and then takes the determinant of the result.
 In other words, letting 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}(t)$
\end_inset

 denote the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, one has 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{A}(t)=\det(A-tI),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 as usual denotes the identity matrix.
 For example, set 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 2 & 3\\
0 & -2 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\rb.
\]

\end_inset

Evaluating the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $A-tI$
\end_inset

 one gets 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{A}(t)=-t^{3}-t^{2}+6t+7.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the interesting thing about square matrices is that one can do algebra
 with them.
 So if 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix then 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{3}$
\end_inset

, indeed every power of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 will also be a 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Indeed, one can take any polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(t)$
\end_inset

, and happily plug 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 into it.
 The result will be some other 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 The obvious question now is: what will happen when one plugs a square matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 into its own characteristic polynomial? Let's see what happens for the
 sample 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix above.
 Straightforward calculations show that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A^{2}=\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
4 & 1 & 5\\
1 & 5 & -2\\
1 & 0 & 4
\end{array}\rb,\qquad A^{3}=\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
9 & 11 & 13\\
-1 & -10 & 8\\
5 & 6 & 3
\end{array}\rb,
\]

\end_inset

Next adding the various powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with the coefficients of characteristic polynomial (note that one uses
 the identity matrix in place of the constants) one gets 
\size small

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
-A^{3} & -A^{2} & 6A & 7I\\
\\
-\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
9 & 11 & 13\\
-1 & -10 & 8\\
5 & 6 & 3
\end{array}\rb & -\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
4 & 1 & 5\\
1 & 5 & -2\\
1 & 0 & 4
\end{array}\rb & +6\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 2 & 3\\
0 & -2 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\rb & +7\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\rb
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\qquad\qquad=\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\rb
\]

\end_inset


\size default
 Zero! One gets zero.
 This seemingly miraculous answer is not a coincidence.
 Indeed one gets zero regardless of what matrix one starts with.
 I encourage you to try this with a few examples of your own.

Let

The goal of these notes will be to explain and prove the above theorem.
 There are various hidden reasons that make the Cayley-Hamilton theorem
 work.
 It is the purpose of these notes to bring these reasons into the open.

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed there are two factors that make the Cayley-Hamilton theorem such
 a striking and interesting result.
 Recall that if 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional vector space, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{1},\vu_{2},\vu_{3},\ldots,\vu_{n+1}$
\end_inset

, are any 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 vectors in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, then there will some kind of a linear relation between the 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{i}$
\end_inset

's, i.e.
 for some choice of scalars 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 one will have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{1}\vu_{1}+a_{2}\vu_{2}+a_{3}\vu_{3}+\ldots a_{n+1}\vu_{n+1}=0.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the space of 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrices is 
\begin_inset Formula $9$
\end_inset

-dimensional.
 Therefore for every 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 there must be a linear relationship between the 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 different matrix powers 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A^{9},A^{8},A^{7},A^{6},A^{5},A^{4},A^{3},A^{2},A^{1}=A,A^{0}=I.
\]

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

miracle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem is twofold.
 First, a linear relation arises already for the powers 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{3},A^{2},A^{1},A^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Second, the coefficients for this linear relation are precisely the coefficient
s of the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's put it another way.
 Look at the first column vectors of the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{3},A^{2},A^{1},A^{0}$
\end_inset

 the vectors

\end_inset

Now 
\begin_inset Formula $\reals^{3}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

-dimensional vector space, and so there should be a linear relation between
 the above 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 vectors.
 Indeed there is: the coefficients of the linear relation are 
\begin_inset Formula $-1,-1,6,7$
\end_inset

 ( i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 times the first vector, plus 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 times the second, plus 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

 times the third, plus 
\begin_inset Formula $7$
\end_inset

 times the fourth is equal to zero --- try it yourself!).
 What about the second column vectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{3},A^{2},A^{1},A^{0}$
\end_inset

? Now the vectors in question are

Again, we have here

 vectors from a

 between the vectors.
 However by some miracle the coefficients of the linear relation for the
 second column vectors are the same as the coefficients of the linear relation
 between the first column vectors, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $-1,-1,6,7$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, these coefficients are precisely the coefficients of the character
istic polynomial: 
\begin_inset Formula $-t^{3}-t^{2}+6t+7$
\end_inset

 Needless to say the third column vectors are joined in a linear relation
 with the same coefficients:

 Why is this happening?

\end_inset

and let's take these 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 vectors as a new basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bB$
\end_inset

.
 A basis obtained in this fashion, i.e.
 by starting with a vector and successively applying a matrix to it, is
 called a cyclic basis.
 What will be the representation of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 relative to this cyclic basis? Now 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{0}$
\end_inset

 is just the first elementary vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ve_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{1}$
\end_inset

 is nothing but 
\begin_inset Formula $A\vu_{0}$
\end_inset

, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{2}=A\vu_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Now 
\begin_inset Formula $A\vu_{2}$
\end_inset

 is the first column vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{3}$
\end_inset

 and we already determined the linear relation between the first column
 vectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{3},\ldots A^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The bottom line is that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\vu_{2}=-(\vu_{2}-6\vu_{1}-7\vu_{0}),
\]

\end_inset

and consequently 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 will have the following appearance relative to the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\bB$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[A]_{\bB}=\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
0 & 0 & 7\\
1 & 0 & 6\\
0 & 1 & -1
\end{array}\rb
\]

\end_inset

The transition matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\bB$
\end_inset

 to the standard basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\ve_{1},\ve_{2},\ve_{3}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P=\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 1 & 4\\
0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\rb.
\]

\end_inset

Of course 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is relevant to our discussion precisely because 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[A]_{\bB}=P^{-1}AP.
\]

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be an

\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 a non-singular 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix, and set 
\begin_inset Formula $B=P^{-1}AP$
\end_inset

.
 The matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 have the same characteristic polynomials.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is given as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det(B-tI)=\det\lp P^{-1}AP-tI\rp=\det\lp P^{-1}(A-tI)P\rp.
\]

\end_inset

Recall that the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants,
 and that the determinant of an inverse is the inverse of the determinant.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det(B-tI)=\det(P^{-1})\det(A-tI)\det(P)=\det(A-tI).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, according to the above theorem we should expect the characterist
ic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $[A]_{\bB}$
\end_inset

 to be equal to the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Let's check this using a co-factor expansion.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\begin{array}{ccc}
-t & 0 & 7\\
1 & -t & 6\\
0 & 1 & -1-t
\end{array}\right|=-t(t^{2}+t-6)+7\cdot1=-t^{3}-t^{2}+6t+7
\]

\end_inset

Also note that the last column of 
\begin_inset Formula $[A]_{\bB}$
\end_inset

 contains all but one of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.
 This too is not a coincidence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 Consider an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 such that the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{\mbox{{\rm th}}}$
\end_inset

 column vector for 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,2,\ldots n-1$
\end_inset

 is the basic vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\ve_{j+1}$
\end_inset

, while the last column of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $[-b_{0},-b_{1},\ldots,-b_{n-1}]^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 has the following form: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B=\lb\begin{array}{cccccc}
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & -b_{0}\\
1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & -b_{1}\\
0 & 1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & -b_{2}\\
0 & 0 & 1 & \ldots & 0 & -b_{3}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 1 & -b_{n-1}
\end{array}\rb
\]

\end_inset

Then, the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(-1)^{n}p_{B}(t)=t^{n}+b_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\ldots+b_{2}t^{2}+b_{1}t+b_{0}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We will calculate the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $B-tI$
\end_inset

 by doing a co-factor expansion along the first row.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}$
\end_inset

 be the matrix obtained by deleting the first row and the first column from
 
\begin_inset Formula $B-tI$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 be the matrix obtained by deleting the first row and the last column from
 
\begin_inset Formula $B-tI$
\end_inset

.
 Doing a co-factor expansion along the top row, it is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det(B-tI)=-t\det(B_{1})+(-1)^{n}b_{0}\det(D).
\]

\end_inset

Now 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is an upper triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal, and therefore
 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(D)=1$
\end_inset

.
 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}$
\end_inset

, on the other hand has the same structure as 
\begin_inset Formula $B-tI$
\end_inset

, only it's 1 size smaller.
 To that end let 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{2}$
\end_inset

 be the matrix obtained by deleting the first two rows and columns from
 
\begin_inset Formula $B-tI$
\end_inset

.
 By the same reasoning as above it's easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det(B_{1})=-t\det(B_{2})+(-1)^{n-1}b_{1},
\]

\end_inset

and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\det(B-tI)=(-1)^{n}b_{0}-t\Big((-1)^{n-1}b_{1}-t\det(B_{2})\Big).
\]

\end_inset

Continuing inductively we see that for even 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $B-tI$
\end_inset

 will have the form: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
b_{0}-t\Bigg(-b_{1}-t\Big(b_{2}-t\big(-b_{3}-t(\ldots)\big)\Big)\Bigg)=b_{0}+b_{1}t+b_{2}t^{2}+b_{3}t^{3}+\ldots+b_{n-1}t^{n-1}+t^{n}
\]

\end_inset

For odd 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(B-tI)$
\end_inset

 will be just like the formula above, but multiplied through by a negative
 sign.

\begin_inset Formula $\bB$
\end_inset

, of 
\begin_inset Formula $\reals^{n}$
\end_inset

 (There are matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 for which this doesn't happen, but we'll consider this possibility later.)
 There will therefore exist scalars 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0},b_{1},\ldots b_{n-1}$

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vu_{n}+b_{n-1}\vu_{n-1}+\ldots+b_{1}\vu_{1}+b_{0}\vu_{0}=0.
\]

\end_inset

Now the representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 relative to the cyclic basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\bB$
\end_inset

 will have the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[A]_{\bB}=\lb\begin{array}{cccccc}
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & -b_{0}\\
1 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & -b_{1}\\
0 & 1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & -b_{2}\\
0 & 0 & 1 & \ldots & 0 & -b_{3}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 1 & -b_{n-1}
\end{array}\rb
\]

\end_inset

By Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $[A]_{\bB}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, by Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:ratform"

\end_inset

 the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $[A]_{\bB}$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pm(t^{n}+b_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\ldots b_{1}t+b_{0}).
\]

\end_inset

Only one conclusion is possible: 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{0},b_{1},\ldots,b_{n-1}$
\end_inset

 must be precisely the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 Let us summarize these findings.

 matrix, with characteristic polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula

 If the vectors

\begin_layout Section
A Complication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are almost done with the proof of the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem.
 First, however, we must deal with the possibility that the square matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is such that the column vectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{0},A^{1},\ldots,A^{n-1}$
\end_inset

 do not form a basis.
 Consider, for example 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & -1 & 2\\
1 & 4 & -4\\
1 & 2 & -2
\end{array}\rb
\]

\end_inset

An easy calculation shows that the characteristic polynomial is given by
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{A}(t)=t^{3}-3t^{2}+t+2.
\]

\end_inset

Writing down the sequence of powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
A^{3} & A^{2} & A^{1} & A^{0}\\
\\
\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
3 & -2 & 4\\
2 & 15 & -14\\
2 & 7 & -6
\end{array}\rb & \quad\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
2 & -1 & 2\\
1 & 7 & -6\\
1 & 3 & -2
\end{array}\rb & \quad\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & -1 & 2\\
1 & 4 & -4\\
1 & 2 & -2
\end{array}\rb & \quad\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\rb
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

we notice that the first columns do, in fact, obey a linear relation with
 the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial:

, and therefore Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:cols"

\end_inset

 is not enough to explain why these vectors obey the above linear relation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to find an explanation, let us proceed as follows.
 Just as before, start by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{0}=\ve_{1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{1}=A\vu_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If we take 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{2}=A\vu_{1}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\bB=(\vu_{0},\vu_{1},\vu_{2})$
\end_inset

 will not form a basis, so instead, let us choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{2}$
\end_inset

 that is linearly independent from 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{1}$
\end_inset

, thereby ensuring that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bB$
\end_inset

 is a basis.
 There are many, many possible such choices for 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 To keep the discussion concrete, let us take 
\begin_inset Formula $\vu_{2}=\ve_{3}=[0,0,1]^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\vu_{0}=\vu_{1}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\vu_{1}=[2,1,1]^{T}=\vu_{0}+\vu_{1}.
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\vu_{2}=[2,-4,2]^{T}=6\vu_{0}-4\vu_{1}+2\vu_{2}.
\]

\end_inset

Therefore, representing 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 relative to the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\bB$
\end_inset

 we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[A]_{\bB}=\lb\begin{array}{rrr}
0 & 1 & 6\\
1 & 1 & -4\\
0 & 0 & 2
\end{array}\rb
\]

\end_inset

By Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:conj"

\end_inset

, we know that the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $[A]_{\bB}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 However, we know much more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 be an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B=\lb\begin{array}{cc}
B_{1} & B_{2}\\
\mathbf{0} & B_{3}

\begin_inset Formula $B_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $B_{3}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-k)\times(n-k)$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Then, the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the product of the characteristic polynomials of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B-tI=\lb\begin{array}{cc}
B_{1}-tI_{1} & B_{2}\\
\mathbf{0} & B_{3}-tI_{3}

\end_inset

 identity matrix, and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{3}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-k)\times(n-k)$
\end_inset

 The Proposition now follows from the fact that the determinant of a matrix
 whose shape is like 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is the determinant of the upper-left block times the determinant of the
 lower-right block.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Next think about what it means to multiply a polynomial such as 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{2}-t-1$
\end_inset

 by another polynomial such as 
\begin_inset Formula $t-2$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, one can structure the multiplication by multiplying the first polynomia
l through by 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, then multiplying it through by 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

, and then adding the two terms: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
t^{3} & -t^{2} & -t\\
 & -2t^{2} & 2t & 2\\
\hline t^{3} & -3t^{2} & +t & +2
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

The bottom line is, of course, just the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p_{A}(t)$
\end_inset

 can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

formed out of
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{2}-t-1$

 This shows that we can combine relations (

LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:comp1"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 All we have to do is take relation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

), and add to it 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

 times the relation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This explains why the first column vectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{3},A^{2},A^{1},A^{0}$

 obey a linear relation whose coefficients come from the characteristic

\emph default

Properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, 
\begin_inset Formula $\operatorname{End}(V)$
\end_inset

 is a vector space of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{2}+1$
\end_inset

 vectors, 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{v},T,T^{2},\ldots T^{n^{2}}$
\end_inset

, are linearly dependant.
 So there are coefficients, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 not all zero such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=0}^{n^{2}}a_{i}T^{i}=0$
\end_inset

.
 We conclude that a non-trivial zero polynomial for 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 exists.
 We take 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{T}(X)$
\end_inset

 to be a zero polynomial for

 of minimal degree with leading coefficient one.

\begin_layout Lemma
If

\begin_layout Proof
 By the division algorithm for polynomials, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(X)=Q(X)M_{T}(X)+R(X)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\deg R<\deg M_{T}$
\end_inset

.
 We note that 
\begin_inset Formula $R(X)$
\end_inset

 is also a zero polynomial for 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and by minimality of

\begin_layout Enumerate
The roots are exactly the eigenvalues of the endomorphism.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the minimal polynomial of

\begin_layout Enumerate
The minimal polynomial of

 no repeated roots) if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is diagonal with respect to some basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is then a simple corollary of the fundamental theorem of algebra that
 every endomorphism of a finite dimensional vector space over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 may be upper-triangularized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimal polynomial is intimately related to the characteristic polynomial
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 For let 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{T}(X)$
\end_inset

 be the characteristc polynomial.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{T}(T)=0$
\end_inset

, we have by the above lemma that 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{T}(X)\mid\chi_{T}(X)$
\end_inset

.
 It is also a fact that the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 are exactly the roots of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{T}$
\end_inset

.
 So when split into linear factors the only difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{T}(X)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{T}(X)$
\end_inset

 is the algebraic multiplicity of the roots.

In general they may not be the same--for example any diagonal matrix with
 repeated eigenvalues.

\begin_layout Proof
This theorem can be proved combining the cyclic decomposition theorem and
 the primary decomposition theorem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
By hypothesis, the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 factorizes completely over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}$
\end_inset

, and then so does the minimal polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 (or its annihilator polynomial).
 This is because the minimal polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 has exactly the same factors on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}[X]$
\end_inset

 as the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 Let's suppose then that the minimal polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 factorizes as 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{T}=(X-\lambda_{1})^{\alpha_{1}}\ldots(X-\lambda_{r})^{\alpha_{r}}$
\end_inset

.
 We know, by the primary decomposition theorem, that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{r}\ker((T-\lambda_{i}I)^{\alpha_{i}}).
\]

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{i}$
\end_inset

 be the restriction of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ker((T-\lambda_{i}I)^{\alpha_{i}})$
\end_inset

.
 We apply now the cyclic decomposition theorem to every linear operator
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(T_{i}-\lambda_{i}I)\,\colon\,\ker(T-\lambda_{i}I)^{\alpha_{i}}\longrightarrow\ker(T-\lambda_{i}I)^{\alpha_{i}}.
\]

\end_inset

We know then that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ker(T-\lambda_{i}I)^{\alpha_{i}}$
\end_inset

 has a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}=B_{1,i}\bigcup B_{2,i}\bigcup\ldots\bigcup B_{d_{i},i}$
\end_inset

 such that each 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{s,i}$
\end_inset

 is of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{s,i}=\{v_{s,i},(T-\lambda_{i})v_{s,i},(T-\lambda_{i})^{2}v_{s,i},\ldots,(T-\lambda_{i})^{k_{s,i}}v_{s,i}\}.
\]

\begin_layout Standard
Let's see that 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in each of this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cyclic sub-basis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{s,i}$
\end_inset

 is a Jordan block: Simply notice the following fact about this polynomials:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
X(X-\lambda_{i})^{j} & = & (X-\lambda_{i})^{j+1}+X(X-\lambda_{i})^{j}-(X-\lambda_{i})^{j+1}\\
 & = & (X-\lambda_{i})^{j+1}+(X-X+\lambda_{i})(X-\lambda_{i})^{j}\\
 & = & (X-\lambda_{i})^{j+1}+\lambda_{i}(X-\lambda_{i})^{j}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

and then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T(T-\lambda_{i}I)^{j}(v_{s,i})=(T-\lambda_{i})^{j+1}(v_{s,i})+\lambda_{i}(T-\lambda_{i}I)^{j}(v_{s,i}).
\]

\end_inset

So, if we also notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $(T-\lambda_{i}I)^{k_{s,i}+1}(v_{s,i})=0$
\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in this sub-basis is the Jordan block 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}\lambda_{i} & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0\\
1 & \lambda_{i} & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & \lambda_{i} & \cdots & 0 & 0\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & \lambda_{i} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & \lambda_{i}
\end{pmatrix}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, taking the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $B=B_{1}\bigcup B_{2}\bigcup\ldots\bigcup B_{r}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 in this basis has a Jordan form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This form is unique (except for the order of the blocks) due to the uniqueness
 of the cyclic decomposition.

 This is a real matrix.
 So, nonreal eigenvalues must occur in pairs of conjugates.
 So, the other distinct eigenvalue of

 must be 
\begin_inset Formula $-i$
\end_inset

 Therefore, the minimal polynomial of

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[(x-i)(x+i)\right]^{k}=(x^{2}+1)^{k}\textrm{ for some }k\in\left\{ 1,2,3\right\} .

The characteristic polynomial is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\lambda^{2}+1\right)^{3}$
\end_inset

 Hence the six eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm i$

 both

 This implies that

 But it is easy to see that the topright element of

\end_inset

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Given a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in M(n\times n)$
\end_inset

, is it possible to find a basis in which the associated linear transformation
 is represented by a diagonal matrix? In other words, can we find an invertible
 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
D=S^{-1}AS\label{e.d}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

is diagonal? Writing 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D=\begin{pmatrix}\lambda_{1} &  & 0\\
 & \ddots\\
0 &  & \lambda_{n}
\end{pmatrix}\quad\text{and}\quad S=\begin{pmatrix}| &  & |\\
\v_{1} & \cdots & \v_{n}\\
| &  & |
\end{pmatrix}\,,

\end_inset

i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}

\begin_inset Formula $\v_{1},\dots,\v_{n}$
\end_inset

 are the columns of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 can be written 
\begin_inset Formula $SD=AS$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}| &  & |\\
\lambda_{1}\v_{1} & \cdots & \lambda_{n}\v_{n}\\
| &  & |

\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 are the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, and the columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 are the corresponding eigenvectors.
 Therefore, our task is the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Find 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 eigenvalues, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 linearly independent eigenvectors of

.

\begin_layout Section
Computing Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example, let's consider the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i & i\\
i & 0 & -i\\
-i & i & 0
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Step 1: Compute and factor the characteristic polynomial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristic polynomial is defined 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{A}(\lambda)=\det(A-\lambda I)\,.
\]

\end_inset

It is zero if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $A-\lambda I$
\end_inset

 is singular, i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

if and only if the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $A\v=\lambda\v$
\end_inset

 has a nontrivial solution, i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvalue.
 In order to find the zeros, try to write the characteristic polynomial
 as a product of linear factors: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{A}(\lambda)=\pm(\lambda-\lambda_{1})\cdots(\lambda-\lambda_{n})\,.
\]

\end_inset

Notice that some linear factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda-\lambda_{k}$
\end_inset

 may occur more than once.
 In that case it is crucial that the dimension of the corresponding eigenspace,
 i.e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

the dimension of the solution space of the linear system 
\begin_inset Formula $(A-\lambda_{k}I)\v_{k}=0$
\end_inset

 has the same multiplicity.
 If its dimension is less than the multiplicity of the eigenvalue, the matrix
 cannot be diagonalized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our example, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p_{A}(\lambda) & =\begin{vmatrix}-\lambda & -i & i\\
i & -\lambda & -i\\
-i & i & -\lambda
\end{vmatrix}\\
 & =-\lambda^{3}+(-i)^{3}+i^{3}-3\,(-\lambda)\, i\,(-i)\\
 & =-\lambda\,(\lambda^{2}-3)\\
 & =-\lambda\,(\lambda+\sqrt{3})\,(\lambda-\sqrt{3})\,.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore the three eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=-\sqrt{3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=\sqrt{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the eigenvalues are distinct, we already know that the matrix must
 be diagonalizable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Step 2: Compute the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,\dots,n$
\end_inset

 we have to solve the homogeneous equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(A-\lambda_{k})\v_{k}=0\,.
\]

\end_inset

In this example, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(A-\lambda_{1})\v_{1}=\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i & i\\
i & 0 & -i\\
-i & i & 0
\end{pmatrix}=0\,.
\]

\end_inset

After row-reduction, we obtain the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & -1\\
0 & 1 & -1\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\,,
\]

\end_inset

thus the first eigenvector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\v_{1}=(-1,-1,-1)^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Next, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(A-\lambda_{2})\v_{2}=\begin{pmatrix}\sqrt{3} & -i & i\\
i & \sqrt{3} & -i\\
-i & i & \sqrt{3}
\end{pmatrix}=0\,.
\]

\end_inset

Let's row-reduce this matrix: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
 & \begin{pmatrix}\sqrt{3} & -i & i\\
i & \sqrt{3} & -i\\
-i & i & \sqrt{3}
\end{pmatrix}\xrightarrow{\substack{\text{R1}/\sqrt{3}\to\text{R1}\\
i\text{R2}\to\text{R2}\\
i\text{R3}\to\text{R3}
}
}\begin{pmatrix}1 & -\tfrac{i}{\sqrt{3}} & \tfrac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\\
-1 & \sqrt{3}i & 1\\
1 & -1 & \sqrt{3}i
\end{pmatrix}\xrightarrow{\substack{\text{R1}+\text{R2}\to\text{R2}\\
\text{R2}+\text{R3}\to\text{R3}
}
}\\
 & \begin{pmatrix}1 & -\tfrac{i}{\sqrt{3}} & \tfrac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\\
0 & \tfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}}i & 1+\tfrac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\\
0 & \sqrt{3}i-1 & 1+\sqrt{3}i
\end{pmatrix}\xrightarrow{\substack{-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\text{R2}\to\text{R2}\\
\text{R3}/(\sqrt{3}i-1)\to\text{R3}
}
}\begin{pmatrix}1 & -\tfrac{i}{\sqrt{3}} & \tfrac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\\
0 & 1 & \tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
0 & 1 & \tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i
\end{pmatrix}\\
 & \xrightarrow{\substack{\text{R1}-\tfrac{i}{\sqrt{3}}\text{R2}\to\text{R1}\\
\text{R2}-\text{R3}\to\text{R3}
}
}\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & \tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
0 & 1 & \tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\v_{2}=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
\tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
-1
\end{pmatrix}\,,\qquad\v_{3}=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
-1
\end{pmatrix}\,,
\]

\end_inset

where the computation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\v_{3}$
\end_inset

 is very similar to the previous one.
 Hence, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & -\sqrt{3} & 0\\
0 & 0 & \sqrt{3}
\end{pmatrix}\,,\qquad S=\begin{pmatrix}-1 & \tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i & \tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
-1 & \tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i & \tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
-1 & -1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Step 3: Check your solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easiest to check that 
\begin_inset Formula $SD=AS$
\end_inset

, because this does not require the computation of a matrix inverse.
 In this example, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
SD & =\begin{pmatrix}-1 & \tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i & \tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
-1 & \tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i & \tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
-1 & -1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & -\sqrt{3} & 0\\
0 & 0 & \sqrt{3}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0 & -\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-\tfrac{3}{2}i & \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-\tfrac{3}{2}i\\
0 & -\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\tfrac{3}{2}i & \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\tfrac{3}{2}i\\
0 & \sqrt{3} & -\sqrt{3}
\end{pmatrix}\\
AS & =\begin{pmatrix}0 & -i & i\\
i & 0 & -i\\
-i & i & 0
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}-1 & \tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i & \tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
-1 & \tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i & \tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
-1 & -1 & -1
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0 & -\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-\tfrac{3}{2}i & \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}-\tfrac{3}{2}i\\
0 & -\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\tfrac{3}{2}i & \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\tfrac{3}{2}i\\
0 & \sqrt{3} & -\sqrt{3}

Proof of Cauchy--Schwarz inequality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 are linearly dependent, we write 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{b}=\lambda\boldsymbol{a}$
\end_inset

.
 So we get: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\langle\boldsymbol{a},\lambda\boldsymbol{a}\rangle^{2}=\lambda^{2}\langle\boldsymbol{a},\boldsymbol{a}\rangle^{2}=\lambda^{2}||\boldsymbol{a}||^{4}=||\boldsymbol{a}||^{2}||\boldsymbol{b}||^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

So we have equality if 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{b}$
\end_inset

 are linearly dependent.
 In the other case we look at the quadratic function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
||x\cdot\boldsymbol{a}+\boldsymbol{b}||^{2}=x^{2}||\boldsymbol{a}||^{2}+2x\langle\boldsymbol{a},\boldsymbol{b}\rangle+||\boldsymbol{b}||^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

This function is positive for every real 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{b}$
\end_inset

 are linearly independent.
 Thus it has no real zeroes, which means that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\langle\boldsymbol{a},\boldsymbol{b}\rangle^{2}-||\boldsymbol{a}||^{2}||\boldsymbol{b}||^{2}
\]

\end_inset

is always negative.
 So we have: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\langle\boldsymbol{a},\boldsymbol{b}\rangle^{2}<||\boldsymbol{a}||^{2}||\boldsymbol{b}||^{2},
\]

\end_inset

which is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality if 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{b}$
\end_inset

 are linearly independent.

If the number of equations equals the number of variables (

With these assumptions, there exists a unique solution, which can be obtained

For the general case, the termination procedure is somewhat more complicated.
 First recall that a matrix is in echelon form if each row has more leading
 zeros than the rows above it.
 A pivot is the leading non-zero entry of some row.
 We then have 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If there is a pivot in the last column, the system is inconsistent ; there
 will be no solutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If that is not the case, then the general solution will have

 degrees of freedom, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the number of columns from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 that have no pivot.
 To be more precise, the general solution will have the form of one particular
 solution plus an arbitrary linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 linearly independent 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

-vectors.

 The general solution is then obtained by arbitrarily choosing values of

A variant of Gaussian elimination is Gauss-Jordan elimination.
 In this variation we reduce to echelon form, and then if the system proves
 to be consistent, continue to apply the elementary row operations until

 This means that not only does each pivot have all zeroes below it, but
 that each pivot also has all zeroes above it.

\begin_layout Standard
In essence, Gauss-Jordan elimination performs the back substitution; the
 values of the unknowns can be read off directly from the terminal augmented
 matrix.
 Not surprisingly, Gauss-Jordan elimination is slower than Gaussian elimination.
 It is useful, however, for solving systems on paper.

A system of linear equation is generally of the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A\,\x=\b\,,\label{e.linear}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in M(n\times m)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\b\in\R^{n}$
\end_inset

 are given, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\x=(x_{1},\dots,x_{m})^{T}$
\end_inset

 is the vector of unknowns.
 For example, the system 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
x_{2}+2\, x_{3}-x_{4} & =1\\
x_{1}+x_{3}+x_{4} & =4\\
-x_{1}+x_{2}-x_{4} & =2\\
2\, x_{2}+3\, x_{3}-x_{4} & =7
\end{align*}

\end_inset

can be written in the form 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 2 & -1\\

0 & 2 & 3 & -1
\end{pmatrix}\,,\qquad\b=\begin{pmatrix}1\\

\]

\end_inset

To simplify notation, we write 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\b$
\end_inset

 into a single 
\emph on
augmented matrix

\begin_inset Formula

Step 2: Bring

 into 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of this step is to bring the augmented matrix into 
\emph on
reduced row echelon form
\emph default
.
 A matrix is in this form if 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the first non-zero entry of each row is 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, this element is referred to as the 
\emph on
pivot
\emph default
, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each pivot is the only non-zero entry in its column, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
each row has at least as many leading zeros as the previous row.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the following matrix is in row echelon form, where 
\begin_inset Formula $*$
\end_inset

 could be any, possibly non-zero, number: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & * & 0 & * & * & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & * & * & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

Three types of 
\emph on
elementary row operations
\emph default
 are permitted in this process, namely 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(A) exchanging two rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(B) multiplying a row by a non-zero scalar,.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
(C) adding a multiple of one row to another row.

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step 3: Zero, one, or many solutions?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two fundamentally different situations: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
regular
\emph default
.
 In this case, the left-hand block of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 has been reduced to the identity matrix.
 There is exactly one solution, independent of which vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\b$
\end_inset

 you started out with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
degenerate
\emph default
.
 In this case, the left-hand block of the row-reduced augmented matrix has
 more columns than non-zero rows.
 Then, dependent on which vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\b$
\end_inset

 you started out with, there is either no solution at all (the system is
 
\emph on
inconsistent
\emph default
), or an infinite number of solutions (the system is 
\emph on
underdetermined
\emph default
).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the rightmost column of the row-reduced augmented matrix has a nonzero
 entry in a row that is otherwise zero, the system is inconsistent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Otherwise, the general solution has the following structure.
 It is the sum of a 
\emph on
particular solution
\emph default
 of the 
\emph on
inhomogeneous equation
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $A\x=\b$
\end_inset

 and the 
\emph on
general solution
\emph default
 of the 
\emph on
homogeneous equation
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $A\x=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step 4: Write out the solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the left-hand block of the row-reduced matrix is not square, make it
 square by adding or removing rows of zeros.
 This has to be done in such a way that the leading 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 in each row (the 
\emph on
pivot
\emph default
) lies on the diagonal! 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The rightmost column of the row-reduced augmented matrix is a particular
 solution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To find a basis for the general solution of the homogeneous system, proceed
 as follows: Take every column of the row-reduced augmented matrix that
 has a zero on the diagonal.
 Replace that zero by 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 The set of these column vectors is the basis you need.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the example above, a particular solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $(9,11,-5,0)^{T}$
\end_inset

 and the general solution of the homogeneous equation is a one-dimensional
 subspace with basis vector 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,1,-1,-1)^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the general solution to the inhomogeneous equation 
\begin_inset Formula $A\x=\b$
\end_inset

 is the line 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\x=\begin{pmatrix}9\\
11\\
-5\\
0
\end{pmatrix}+\lambda\begin{pmatrix}2\\
1\\
-1\\
-1
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Another example: Assume that the row-reduced matrix is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\begin{matrix}0 & 0 & 1 & -3 & 0 & 4\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 6
\end{matrix}\right.\left|\left.\begin{matrix}-3\\
7
\end{matrix}\right)\right.\,.
\]

\end_inset

Padding the matrix with the required rows of zeros gives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\begin{matrix}0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & -3 & 0 & 4\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 6\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{matrix}\right.\left|\left.\begin{matrix}0\\
0\\
-3\\
0\\
7\\
0
\end{matrix}\right)\right.\,,
\]

\end_inset

and the general solution is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\x=\begin{pmatrix}0\\
0\\
-3\\
0\\
7\\
0
\end{pmatrix}+\lambda_{1}\begin{pmatrix}-1\\
0\\
0\\
0\\
0\\
0
\end{pmatrix}+\lambda_{2}\begin{pmatrix}0\\
-1\\
0\\
0\\
0\\
0
\end{pmatrix}+\lambda_{3}\begin{pmatrix}0\\
0\\
-3\\
-1\\
0\\
0
\end{pmatrix}+\lambda_{4}\begin{pmatrix}0\\
0\\
4\\
0\\
6\\
-1
\end{pmatrix}\,.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Step 5: Check your solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By multiplying 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with the vectors representing the solution, you can easily verify that
 the computation is correct.
 In our example, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
A\begin{pmatrix}9\\
11\\
-5\\
0
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 2 & -1\\

-1 & 1 & 0 & -1\\
0 & 2 & 3 & -1
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}9\\
11\\
-5\\
0
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1\\
4\\
2\\
7
\end{pmatrix}=\b\,,\\
A\begin{pmatrix}2\\
1\\
-1\\
-1
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 & 2 & -1\\

-1 & 1 & 0 & -1\\
0 & 2 & 3 & -1
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}2\\
1\\

Properties of the Matrix Inverse

\begin_layout Standard
Given a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in M(n\times n)$
\end_inset

, its inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is the matrix with the property that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
AA^{-1}=I=A^{-1}A\,.
\]

\end_inset

Note the following identities (see Riley, Hobson & Bence, p.
\begin_inset space \space{}

271): 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $(A^{-1})^{-1}=A$

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is invertible, then the solution to the system of linear equations 
\begin_inset Formula $A\x=\b$
\end_inset

 can be written 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\x=A^{-1}\b\,.
\]

\end_inset

This observation tells us how we can compute the matrix inverse once we
 know how to solve linear equations.
 We begin by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\b$
\end_inset

 as a linear combination of the standard unit vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\e_{1},\dots,\e_{n}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\b=b_{1}\e_{1}+\dots+\b_{n}\e_{n}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\x=A^{-1}\,\bigl(b_{1}\e_{1}+\dots+\b_{n}\e_{n}\bigr)=b_{1}A^{-1}\e_{1}+\dots+b_{n}A^{-1}\e_{n}\,.
\]

\end_inset

Notice that the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\x_{1}=A^{-1}\e_{1},\dots\x_{n}=A^{-1}\e_{n}$
\end_inset

 are the columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 At the same time, we see that these vectors are the solutions to the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 linear equations 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\x_{1}=\e_{1}\,,\quad\cdots\quad A\x_{n}=\e_{n}\,.
\]

\end_inset

To find 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 we therefore have to simultaneously solve 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 inhomogeneous linear equations, which is the essence of the following procedure.

\begin_layout Definition
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times m$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 An LU decomposition (sometimes also called an LU factorization) of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, if it exists, is an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 unit lower triangular matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times m$
\end_inset

 matrix U, in (upper) echelon form, such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=LU
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LU factorization is closely related to the row reduction algorithm.
 In a very real sense, the factorization is a record of the steps taken
 in row reducing a matrix to echelon form.
 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

encodes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the sequence of row replacement operations that row reduce the given matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to echelon form 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $A=LU$
\end_inset

 is an LU factorization, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{ij}$
\end_inset

 denote the entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 Then, the row reduction 
\begin_inset Formula $A\stackrel{\rho}{\Longrightarrow}U$
\end_inset

 is accomplished by the following sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tfrac{1}{2}n(n-1)$
\end_inset

 row replacement operations: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\hskip2em & \row_{j}\mapsto\row_{j}-L_{j1}\;\row_{1},\quad j=2,\ldots,n;\\
 & \row_{j}\mapsto\row_{j}-L_{j2}\;\row_{2},\quad j=3,\ldots,n;\\
 & \hskip3em\vdots\\
 & \row_{j}\mapsto\row_{j}-L_{jk}\;\row_{k},\quad j=k+1,\ldots,n,\quad k=1,\ldots,n-1\\
 & \hskip3em\vdots
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note*
the first 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

 steps clear out column 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, the next 
\begin_inset Formula $n-2$
\end_inset

 steps clear out column 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Not every matrix admits an LU factorization.
 Indeed, an LU factorization exists if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be reduced to echelon without using row exchange operations.
 However, if an LU factorization exists, then it is unique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the most general case, one has to employ row exchange operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times m$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Then, there exists an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 permutation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 (indeed, many such) such that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $PA$
\end_inset

 admits an LU factorization, i.e., there exist matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $P,L,U$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
PA=LU.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key idea behind LU factorization is that one does not need to employ
 row scalings to do row reduction until the second half (the back-substitution
 phase) of the algorithm.
 This has significant implication for numerical stability of the algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LU decomposition of a given matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is useful for the solution of the systems of linear equations of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula $Ax=b$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, it suffices to first solve the linear system 
\begin_inset Formula $Ly=b$
\end_inset

, and second, to solve the system 
\begin_inset Formula $Ux=y$
\end_inset

.
 This two-step procedure is easy to implement, because owing to the lower
 and upper-triangular nature of the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, the required row operations are determined, more or less, directly from
 the entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, the first step, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[\, L\; b\,]\stackrel{\rho_{1}}{\Longrightarrow}[\, I\; y\,]
\]

\end_inset

a sequence of row operations 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{1}$
\end_inset

, and the second step 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[\, U\; y\,]\stackrel{\rho_{2}}{\Longrightarrow}[\, E\; x_{0}\,]
\]

\end_inset

a sequence of row operations 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{2}$
\end_inset

, are exactly the same row operations one has to perform to row reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 directly to reduced echelon form 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[\, A\; b\,]\stackrel{\rho_{1}}{\Longrightarrow}[\, U\; y\,]\stackrel{\rho_{2}}{\Longrightarrow}[\, E\; x_{0}\,].
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Note*
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the particular solution of 
\begin_inset Formula $Ax=b$
\end_inset

 that sits in the rightmost colulmn of the augmented matrix at the termination
 of the row-reduction algorithm.

\begin_layout Chapter
Cholesky Decomposition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A symmetric and positive definite matrix can be efficiently decomposed into
 a lower and upper triangular matrix.
 For a matrix of any type, this is achieved by the LU decomposition which
 factorizes 
\begin_inset Formula $A=LU$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 satisfies the above criteria, one can decompose more efficiently into 
\begin_inset Formula $A=LL^{T}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is a lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal elements.
 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\emph on
Cholesky triangle
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve 
\begin_inset Formula $Ax=b$
\end_inset

, one solves first 
\begin_inset Formula $Ly=b$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, and then 
\begin_inset Formula $L^{T}x=y$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A variant of the Cholesky decomposition is the form 
\begin_inset Formula $A=R^{T}R$
\end_inset

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is upper triangular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cholesky decomposition is often used to solve the normal equations in linear
 least squares problems; they give 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}Ax=A^{T}b$
\end_inset

 , in which 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}A$
\end_inset

 is symmetric and positive definite.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To derive 
\begin_inset Formula $A=LL^{T}$
\end_inset

, we simply equate coefficients on both sides of the equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n}\\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n}\\
a_{31} & a_{32} & \cdots & a_{3n}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \cdots & a_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}l_{11} & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
l_{21} & l_{22} & \cdots & 0\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
l_{n1} & l_{n2} & \cdots & l_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}l_{11} & l_{21} & \cdots & l_{n1}\\
0 & l_{22} & \cdots & l_{n2}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & \cdots & l_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving for the unknowns (the nonzero 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{ji}$
\end_inset

s), for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\cdots,n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j=i-1,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

, we get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
l_{ii} & = & \sqrt{\left(a_{ii}-\sum_{k=1}^{i-1}l_{ik}^{2}\right)}\\
l_{ji} & = & \left(a_{ji}-\sum_{k=1}^{i-1}l_{jk}l_{ik}\right)/l_{ii}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is symmetric and positive definite, the expression under the square root
 is always positive, and all 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{ij}$
\end_inset

 are real.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The condition number is a measure of stability or sensitivity of a matrix
 (or the linear system it represents) to numerical operations.
 In other words, we may not be able to trust the results of computations
 on an ill-conditioned matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Matrices with condition numbers near 1 are said to be 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 Matrices with condition numbers much greater than one (such as around 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{5}$
\end_inset

 for a 
\begin_inset Formula $5\times5$
\end_inset

 Hilbert matrix) are said to be 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(A)$
\end_inset

 is the condition number of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa(A)$
\end_inset

 measures a sort of inverse distance from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to the set of singular matrices, normalized by 
\begin_inset Formula $\norm A$
\end_inset

.
 Precisely, if 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is invertible, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\norm{B-A}<\norm{A^{-1}}^{-1}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 must also be invertible.
 On the other hand, in the case of the 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

-norm, there always exists a singular matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\norm{B-A}_{2}=\norm{A^{-1}}_{2}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 (so the distance estimate is sharp).

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=USV^{T}

\end_inset

 diagonal matrix with real, non-negative elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$

\end_inset

 in descending order: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{1}\ge\sigma_{2}\ge\dots\ge\sigma_{\min(m,n)}\ge0
\]

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the 
\emph on
singular values
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and the first

\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula $S$

 has the form: 
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is a diagonal matrix with the diagonal elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots,\sigma_{\min(m,n)}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume now 
\begin_inset Formula $m\ge n$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\operatorname{rank}(A)<n$
\end_inset

 , then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma_{1}\ge\sigma_{2}\ge\cdots\ge\sigma_{r}>\sigma_{r+1}=\cdots=\sigma_{n}=0.

If 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{r}\ne0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{r+1}=\cdots=\sigma_{n}=0$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 becomes an 
\begin_inset Formula $r\times r$
\end_inset

 matrix, and 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 shrink accordingly.
 SVD can thus be used for rank determination.

\end_inset

Then utilizing the SVD by making the replacement

Proof of SVD
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prove existence of the SVD, we isolate the direction of the largest action
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\C^{m\times n}$
\end_inset

, and then proceed by induction on the dimension of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 We will denote hermitian conjugation by 
\begin_inset Formula $^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Norms for vectors in 
\begin_inset Formula $\C^{n}$
\end_inset

 will be the usual euclidean 2-norm 
\begin_inset Formula $\norm{\cdot}=\norm{\cdot}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and for matrix the induced by norm of vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}=\norm A$
\end_inset

.
 By a compactness argument, there must be vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}\in\C^{n},u_{1}^{*}\in\C^{m}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\norm{v_{1}}=1,\norm{u_{1}^{*}}=\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}=Av_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Normalize 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}=u_{1}^{*}/\norm{u_{1}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 and consider any extensions of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 to an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{v_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\C^{n}$
\end_inset

 and of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}$
\end_inset

 to an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{u_{j}\}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\C^{m}$
\end_inset

; let 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 denote the unitary matrices with columns 
\begin_inset Formula $\{v_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{u_{j}\}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Then we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{1}^{T}AV_{1}=S=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma_{1} & w^{T}\\
0 & B
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

where 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 is a column vector of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $m-1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $w^{T}$
\end_inset

 is a row vector of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is a matrix of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $(m-1)\times(n-1)$
\end_inset

.
 Now,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\norm{\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\sigma_{1} & w^{T}\\
0 & B
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\sigma_{1}\\
w
\end{array}\right)}\geq\sigma_{1}^{2}+w^{2}=(\sigma_{1}^{2}+w^{2})^{1/2}\norm{\left(\begin{array}{c}
\sigma_{1}\\
w
\end{array}\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\norm S\geq(\sigma_{1}^{2}+w^{2})^{1/2}$
\end_inset

.
 But 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 are unitary matrix, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\norm S=\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

; it therefore implies 
\begin_inset Formula $w=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
If 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

 we are done.
 Otherwise the submatrix 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 describes the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 on the subspace orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 By the induction hypothesis 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 has an SVD 
\begin_inset Formula $B=U_{2}\Sigma_{2}V_{2}^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Now it is easily verified that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A=U_{1}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & U_{2}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}

0 & \Sigma_{2}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 0\\
0 & V_{2}
\end{array}\right)^{T}V_{1}^{T}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
is an SVD of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 completing the proof of existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the uniqueness let 
\begin_inset Formula $A=U\Sigma V^{T}$
\end_inset

 a SVD for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}$
\end_inset

 denote the i-th, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1\cdots min(m,n)$
\end_inset

 vector of the canonical base of 
\begin_inset Formula $\C^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 are unitary, 
\begin_inset Formula $\norm{Ae_{i}}=\sigma_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

, so each 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 is uniquely determined.

\begin_layout Standard
In finite dimensions it is known that every linear transformation has, at
 least, one eigenvector.
 Of course, the subspace generated by an eigenvector is always invariant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 be an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 the subspace generated by it.
 For self-adjoint transformations, Fact 1 above says that 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 is also invariant by 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, by restriction, we have a self-adjoint operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T:V_{1}^{\perp}\longrightarrow V_{1}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 and we could again find an eigenvector and repeat the same argument.
 Thus, we are decomposing 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 as a direct sum of orthogonal one-dimensional subspaces 
\begin_inset Formula $H=V_{1}\oplus\dots\oplus V_{n}$
\end_inset

, and the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a sum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}P_{i}
\]

\end_inset

where each 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and each 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the orthogonal projection onto the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
This is exactly the process of diagonalization of a self-adjoint matrix.
